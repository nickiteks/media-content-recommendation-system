1,Abyss Odyssey,"Abyss Odyssey is an action platformer game developed by the ACE Team. The game also features several roguelike elements.
Plot
The game follows several heroes that descend into the dungeons of a 19th century Chile city of Santiago to find a warlock, whose dreams wreck havoc on the streets of a South American town.
Gameplay
In its gameplay, Abyss Odyssey fuses several genres into one, creating something absolutely new. The players control a character, whose main objective is to complete procedurally generated levels without dying and killing as many monsters as they can on the way to the exit from the level. The implementation of procedural generation results in a high degree of replayability as no level will play out the same.
Due to the infusion of roguelike elements to the game, the players only have one life. Upon death, the players are given a weaker character to play as. This new character sets out to avenge the death of a previous one. It is possible to revive your dead character by finding them and using a special alter that has to be found somewhere on the level. 
The game&#39;s combat is heavily inspired by several Japanese fighting games. The players are awarded new loot upon timing their moves correctly. 
Abyss Odyssey features a unique level unlock system, that is driven by the community. On the game&#39;s release, only the first act was available for playing. The next ones were unlocked upon a certain number of players beating the game&#39;s bosses.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/186/186641799044a7daa32d2845d354758a.jpg

29,Fort Zombie,"FORT ZOMBIE IS BACK!Back by popular demand, the ground-breaking cult classic indie game that kick-started the modern Zombie Survival genre: Fort Zombie.“We have one chance. Find a strong place, and band together. Build our defenses. Gather supplies. Arm ourselves for the fight  and save as many souls as we can. Take back our town, our lives, our world from the hungry dark.That wave will break over this town like a tsunami and take the last of us with them… unless we fight back.”NOTE: THIS GAME IS THE ORIGINAL LEGACY CODE FROM 2009, RELEASED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PLAYERS WHO WANTED ACCESS TO IT.WARNING: NO FURTHER UPDATES are planned for this version of Fort Zombie. Fort Zombie was released in 2009 as a game without a genre: no one had ever attempted this combination of game mechanics before! It is a focused-scope, casual single-player RPG and strategy title of survival during an epic zombie Apocalypse.The game world revolves around a single building – your Fort. Secure your base of operations and then spend the game visiting the mission-specific chunks of Piety, Indiana, the small American town that surrounds you. Search for weapons, supplies, ammunition and the most important resource of all—fellow Survivors.Instead of a major city or a sprawling countryside, the player must focus effort on building up a single structure, finding and training Survivors to battle zombies, and venturing out into town on missions…all while the clock ticks steadily down toward zero hour, when an Apocalyptic wave of zombies from a neighboring city will crash over the town.Targeted directly at the after-work gamer, Fort Zombie was the first debut of many game concepts and features that would be picked up and popularized in the games that followed afterward, including Day Z, Project Zomboid, Dead Rising, State of Decay.FeaturesChoose one of three buildings – the school, the prison, and the police station – as your Fort Zombie, each one with its own strengths and weaknesses!Real time movement and combat keep the tensions level high while trying to achieve objectives before your characters run out of ammunition, food, or luck! Dozens of zombie types, some with special abilities derived from their half-remembered lives before becoming undead! Piety, Indiana, a variable 3D town, created using Kerberos’ mix-and-match tile system, for maximum replayability. PhysX® engine adds to the mayhem!Dozens of town locations to search (stores, restaurants, gas stations, ruins, homes) and countless items to find and use in building up The Fort or building up your group characters (food, fuel, generators, tools, guns, etc.) “Collectible” NPC’s and Survivor families give players access to the Lore of the game, and unlock surprising new abilities—try to find them all!",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b1/4b1c8f1af25a210b12fedee67c597d26.jpg

36,Inner Chains,"An FPS horror game set in a surreal, dark and deadly biomechanical world never seen before.    One does not get to set the rules in the world of Inner Chains. Humankind is just a small part of a hostile universe. Want to survive? Discover its secrets.    A planet in the distant future. A rock floating in space that is no longer what it had once been. Without human interference, nature has been adapting to the new conditions, reclaiming what was once taken away. In its pursuit of perfection, it began to assimilate with the abandoned technology giving life to biomechanical beings.    Left to its own devices, man-made technology has also changed as it tried to adjust to the new environment. A strong symbiosis soon developed between technology and nature. It became difficult to determine what is alive and what is mechanical in the world of Inner Chains.    After several million years of biomechanical evolution, mankind once again became an important part of the ecosystem. However, it hasn’t regained an advanced stage of development. As a result, the human race, oblivious to its own history, cannot fully comprehend or control the powerful technology at its disposal. The people living in the world of Inner Chains take this situation for granted and focus on using the planet’s resources to their advantage. There is also something that has not changed through the millennia: humans are still subject to basic social issues such as faith, dominance, oppression and manipulation. This led to the emergence of multiple castes, and, in consequence, to the supremacy of one particular group. They had discovered these mechanisms first, learned how to use them well that helped them rise to power. Others had to submit.  As one of the inhabitants of this world, your head is filled with the teachings of the Ruling Caste. Your only goal is to get to a mythical place called the Last Hope and leave this degenerated, dying planet once and for all. You embark on your journey full of fanatical zeal, but soon it becomes clear that nothing is what it seems in this strange world. You have to fight for survival, face hostile fauna and flora, and overcome your own weaknesses. You need to stay observant to your surroundings and explore the secrets of the game’s world. Your survival depends entirely on your watchfulness, logical judgment, quick reflexes, accuracy and the ability to use the environment to your advantage.     Features  Dark biomechanical world with deadly fauna and flora  Stunning visuals set in dystopian surrealist style    Variety of challenging opponents   Breathtaking locations with unique settings  Atmospheric, tenebrous soundtrack     Thrilling action combined with intense elements of terror",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe1/fe164348cbb60f73c886c22ab7b430f2_HwZkh1Q.jpg

54,Re-Legion,"In a stagnating technocratic society of a seemingly perfect futuristic world, a cult is born. A strong leader emerges from the crowds and steps in to rid the world of the misery that clenches the society. He brings answers – food for people’s minds – and comfort for their souls. All those seeking higher meaning within the world are accepted. They find their place within a community that fills the void they’ve recently had to cover with drugs and alcohol. But as Elion, their leader and prophet, increases his influence and power, he loses touch with reality and the ideal of salvation gradually turns against those that don’t feel the need for his guidance – the infidels.Fun conceptUsing actual humans as a limiting third resource is a fun concept, and the ability to convert enemy forces directly on the battlefield gave me fond memories of Sacrifice, or Age of Empires' priests.  - PC GamerIn Re-Legion, players Follow Elion’s journey from a lone prophet to the most powerful advocate of religion in the city. Introducing a new alternative to the usual economic and resource management used in RTS games, Re-Legion allows players to convert ordinary non-believing citizens into their units – the followers. Initiated cultists then expand the cult’s possibilities by obtaining cyber-coins to enable upgrades, by praying they increase faith to gain and use special abilities, they hack buildings and ad-boards to expand and control territories, they convert other citizens or fight enemy units and non-believers.The overall direction of the one’s cult is defined by the dogmas chosen for it. From a peaceful religion to one that despises non-believers, each one of dozens of dogmas defines the way in which the cult will pursue its goals. But whichever way you decide to choose, your followers will all work together to build a strong and powerful cult...FeaturesUnique RTS mechanic of acquiring new units by converting citizensVivid futuristic cyberpunk visuals, yet dark atmosphereMature story with profound background and moral choices to be madeSpecial territory control mechanics with the use of hackingHigh replay value both in singleplayer and multiplayer modes",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24e/24e029c7aab4f90ba8ed31e15c387f22.jpg

It is hard to say that &quot;Worms&quot; has any plot at all: there is barely even hints, which may prompt the player to understand the eternal conflict between the worms of a different color. 
The gameplay, on the other hand, is quite memorable: in fact so crucial that not only Worms have given birth to many other worms-like games but also created a whole genre: artillery tactical turn-based strategy. The primary goal of a team or a player is to eliminate the opponent(s). To achieve this goal, one must utilize a various range of weapons.

STORY
One rainy night in November, a woman&#39;s body is found at an abandoned theme park, mounted on a merry-go-round horse. She had been stabbed repeatedly, and her left eye was gouged out.
Kaname Date of the Metropolitan Police Department arrives on the scene. He recognizes the woman. Suddenly, he hears a noise from inside the merry-go-round.
He breaks into the merry-go-round&#39;s central column to find a young girl. And in her hands, she grips a bloody ice pick...",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e03/e035196b873383c7cb7d868f2a73a24c.jpg
149,Alice: Madness Returns,"This sequel to American McGee&#39;s Alice follows the protagonist, Alice Lidell, as she returns to the dark world of her subconsciousness, the nightmarish version of Lewis Carrol’s Wonderland. After she was released from the psychiatric asylum, Alice moved to the orphanage, where she’s being treated with the use of hypnosis. It doesn&#39;t stop her from descending again into the grotesque realm of disturbing visuals, creepy music, and absurdist logic. She will again meet the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the Caterpillar, the Queen of Hearts, and many other darker versions of Carrol’s whimsy characters. Her journey through the Wonderland serves as a metaphor for Alice fighting her own madness.
The game is played in the third-person view. On her way, Alice will jump the platforms, solve puzzles, and fight enemies. The combat system allows for a seamless flow of attacks, dodges, and combos. Besides her trademark Vorpal Blade, Alice will use other, somewhat surreal weapons, such as Teapot Cannon, Clockwork Bomb, or Pepper Grinder. In the sequel, Alice gains a new ability called Hysteria that can be activated when her health is the lowest.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0b5/0b5410b1e4b3fb72696dcefbf4f1cf40.jpg

The game is not a sequel to any of Alien games, but it is directly connected to the original 1979 Alien film, so the gameplay includes historical references, and the game itself transfers the unique atmosphere and the old vision of the future. The action is set 15 years after the film events. Young Amanda Ripley accompanied by Nina Taylor and the android Christopher Samuels reaches a distant space station Sevastopol to investigate the case of her mother Ellen Ripley (the protagonist of the 1979 film) disappearance. On the way to the Nostromo’s (Ellen’s spacecraft) flight recorder, Amanda will face plenty of hardships like hostile androids and Aliens because the Sevastopol station is wholly abandoned. Players have to explore the entire station inhabited with Aliens. Due to the crafting system, players can create the necessary gear to prevent contacts with countless enemies.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/daa/daaee07fcb40744d90cf8142f94a241f.jpg

Play online or over local wifi with 4-10 players as you attempt to hold your spaceship together and return back to civilization. But beware...as there may be an alien impostor aboard!
One crewmate has been replaced by a parasitic shapeshifter. Their goal is to eliminate the rest of the crew before the ship reaches home. The Impostor will sabotage the ship, sneak through vents, deceive, and frame others to remain anonymous and kill off the crew.
While everyone is fixing up the ship, no one can talk to maintain anonymity. Once a body is reported, the surviving crew will openly debate who they think The Impostor is. The Impostor&#39;s goal is to pretend that they are a member of the crew. If The Impostor is not voted off, everyone goes back to maintaining the ship until another body is found. If The Impostor is voted off, the crew wins!",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/e74/e74458058b35e01c1ae3feeb39a3f724.jpg
154,Antichamber,"You control a nameless and faceless protagonist, who starts in a white chamber in the center of a high-tech maze. Your goal is to move forward through the maze by solving many difficult and intricate puzzles. Antichamber reminds Portal game series and Cube films to some extent, but with more emphasis on puzzle solving, sketchy graphics, and very little plot. Unlike in Portal or Cube, the protagonist cannot die, even if the player fails. There are no traps, and the only penalty for failure is that you have to try again. The protagonist is armed with a variety of “guns”, each of them allows you to manipulate a certain set of objects in the maze. 
Antichamber is defined by its impossible, non-euclidian geometry that bends 3D space in the ways not found in the real world. All the regular laws of physic do not apply in this place that seems to be straight out of M. C. Escher&#39;s drawings. Doors can become portals leading to an unpredictable place, or even different places, depending on how you enter them. The visual style of Antichamber is very minimalistic. Walls, doors, and ladders are only outlined with sketch-like black contours, while any color serves to attract the player&#39;s attention to a certain object. Everything else is blank white, which makes for a cold, neat atmosphere of a math exercise.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76f/76ff4289a2a3ad7659cae129b859d67e.jpg
155,Ape Out,"Ape Out is a wildly intense and colorfully stylized smash ‘em up about primal escape, rhythmic violence, and frenetic jazz. Build up nearly unstoppable momentum and use your captors as both weapons and shields to crush everyone on your procedurally generated path to freedom.
Stylish Escape: Embrace bold colors and a dazzling perspective as you rush through tight corridors, open areas, and twisting labyrinths on a mad dash for freedom. Overcome all manner of human opposition, nefarious traps, and breakable obstacles to find each exit and escape captivity.
Grab and Smash: Unleash your primal instincts and incredible strength to overpower your captors. Hold them steady to create a human shield, smash their feeble bodies into walls, or throw one into another in a violent explosion of humanity.
Dynamic Soundtrack: Find your rhythm in the chaos as a dynamic soundtrack of drums, cymbals, and decapitations drive the action to the edge of mayhem.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/b0a/b0a72481e578a70abb8940827ccf1d2d.jpg

157,Arma Tactics,"ARMA Tactics is a standalone spin-off of the ARMA mobile tactics series. While being set in the same universe as its predecessors, the game features a dramatically different type of gameplay.
Premise
The player takes control over a squad of four Special Forces operatives in the modern world. He or she can view them from the top-down &quot;bird&#39;s eye&quot; view in a 3D environment. The scope of a camera is very limited, however. Each character has special skills that can be improved when the character levels up using an RPG-like mechanic of experience points.
Gameplay
The combat and movements in ARMA Tactics are turn-based. Each unit has two action points. They can be spent on movement, healing, attacks, or preparations for an enemy attack. For example, the player can spend a point to order his or her soldier to fire upon seeing an enemy without waiting for his or her turn.
ARMA Tactics relies heavily on the &quot;invisible dice.&quot; A lot of things in the game are randomized, and both the player&#39;s and enemy soldiers can miss their target from the point-blank distance if the game says so.
Modes
The game has two modes. In the story mode, the team completes a series of missions against Islamic terrorists in Africa. The plot is delivered through cutscenes between missions. The other mode offers the player to complete the randomly generated missions. There&#39;s no multiplayer mode.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/128/128ef824b918a2b0bdf9c3a5ccc96a06.jpeg
158,Armello,"Armello is a digital role-playing tabletop game developed by an indie Australian studios League of Geeks. It is the debut project of the game.
Plot
The game is set in a “dark fairytale” kingdom of Armello, where the anthropomorphic animals from many clans live. The king has gone crazy and is slowly dying because of the dark force named the Rot. The representatives of several factions come to the kingdom&#39;s capital to become the new king. Four characters are present at the beginning of the game: Tane the wolf, Amber the rabbit, Mercurio the rat, and Sanah, the bear. 
Gameplay
Armello is a digital remake of a traditional fantasy tabletop role-playing game in which there are rolling dice and cards, that allows the players to execute certain actions. The gaming area is divided into hexagonal plates, that contain procedurally generated features like caves, buildings, other characters or pieces of equipment. As the game progresses, the players can buy in-game currency to purchase special abilities using the skill tree, that is unique to every character.
The game uses a turn-based system, where the players can equip new items or acquire new skills while the other players make their turn. The cards and dice are used only when the players directly interact with the in-game world. The players use cards for casting spells, hiring teammates, treating wounds or using the special items that grant temporary abilities.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/3d2/3d260e4aaeb88b7ac53c81040ac4b80c.jpg

160,Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag,"Assasin&#39;s Creed IV: Black Flag is a pirate game. Being the fourth “numbered” instalment in the series, the story follows a new protagonist, Edward Kenway, who tries to build his Pirate Republic. Help legendary pirates like &quot;Blackbeard&quot;, Charles Vane and other well-known pirates establish their empire while fighting the mystery of the Observatory - something very valuable for the Templars. Also, you will have to continue your infiltration in Abstergo and discover some new details about itself.
Although being in the Assasin&#39;s Creed series, the game provides you with some new mechanics. Giving the player full control of the ship, you will have to cross the open-world sea and fight for your piracy. Ships will be sinking, destroyed and massacred. If you prefer exploring, a whole new underwater world is ready for you with its beauty and danger lurking in the streams of Carribeans. Experience the pirate life at its best. (?) (needs a better ending)",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/849/849414b978db37d4563ff9e4b0d3a787.jpg
161,Assassin's Creed Odyssey,"Assassin&#39;s Creed Odyssey is the twentieth game in its series. It is the earliest game in the Assassin&#39;s Creed universe chronology and the prequel to Assassin&#39;s Creed Origins.
Plot
The events of Assassin&#39;s Creed Odyssey&#39;s take place in the Classical Era of Ancient Greece, in 431 BC, before the Brotherhood of Assassins was even formed. The plot follows a fictionalized story of the Peloponnesian War between city-states of Sparta and Athens that left Greece devastated. The player can choose to control either a male (named Alexios) or female (named Kassandra) protagonist, both of them being descendants of the famous Spartan king Leonidas. The player enters the plot as a mercenary and can side with either Athens or its rival Sparta. There&#39;s also the frame story set in the contemporary age. Its protagonist is Layla Hassan, who was also the main character in the frame story of Assassin&#39;s Creed Origins.
Gameplay
Unlike most earlier installments of Assassin&#39;s Creed, which put the emphasis solely on action, Odyssey has a strong role-playing element in it. Dialogue options and the non-linear plot allow the player to reach several alternate endings. The game also has a reputation system and multiple options for romancing, including same-sex romances. The combat system is similar to that in Origins with the addition of new skills. The game also reintroduces naval battles.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c6b/c6bd26767c1053fef2b10bb852943559.jpg
162,Assassin's Creed Origins,"Assassin&#39;s Creed Origins is an open-world action game developed by Ubisoft. It further continues the series after Assassin&#39;s Creed Syndicate.
The story is set in two time periods simultaneously. In 2017, the order of Templars has recovered an ancient artifact that will allow them to seize control over humanity. Assassins plan to get the artifact back in their hands. Layla Hassan relieves the memories of two ancient Egyptians named Bayek and Aya who create the Assassins order.
Levels are open-ended which allows both stealth or open combat approaches. Players are put in an open world in which they can complete quests in order to either progress through the story, level their character up or upgrade their equipment. The &quot;eagle vision&quot; mode was replaced by an eagle by the name of Senu. Players can use Senu to scout the area ahead and highlight enemies.
The game features a heavily revised combat system that relies on hit-box mechanics rather than pre-determined animations as it did in the previous titles. Origins focuses on introducing various types of enemies that the players will have to learn about in order to defeat them.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/336/336c6bd63d83cf8e59937ab8895d1240.jpg

178,Binary Domain,"Humanity has just solved problems like global warming - with the help of robots. Robot assistants were American, behaved correctly and differed from people clearly. But one madman from Tokyo began to produce robots that do not know that they are robots - and this can be understood because they look and behave exactly like people. This is a violation of the law, and the team of pros from different countries flies to Japan to forever stop the conveyor of the insane inventor. Robots with problems of self-identification can provide a variety for those fans of tactical shooters who are tired of terrorists and zombies.
The game has visually attractive features. The style of opponents, the style of equipping the team of heroes are very attractive and original. Some details of the battles are well presented - bullets knock out picturesque clouds of debris. Locations are less expressive - apparently, so as not to interfere with focusing on the actual combat. A notable feature of the gameplay is the dependence of the relationship in the team on the player&#39;s actions. If the team has bad mutual support - lower trust, lower trust - lower effectiveness in combat.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/bcd/bcd9896b7c3b9fa80e5dcb67c961e2be.jpg

The game’s protagonist is Isaac, a child from a religious family. His misadventures are based off a biblical story about a character of the same name, although the gameplay itself certainly does not follow the same footsteps. There are also additional, unlockable characters with unique abilities and traits, which will affect your playthrough’s difficulty. 
The Binding of Isaac featured non-linear levels, which brought about different outcomes of the game. Depending on the character played, playstyles can also differ, allowing players to create and share new metals for further replayability, and eventual full completion of the game.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/cef/cefedf18016cbab466861eb698daf988.jpg

There are 12 endings in the game.
By controlling Isaac or other of the six characters to choose from, the player must go through several levels of the basement, consisting of many rooms that are procedurally generated in the game, and the places are inhabited by hostile creatures with who you have to fight.

The in-game map suggests that the game is just a bunch of memories of the boy, rather than a real-time progression of events. 
The gameplay changes depending on the scene the player sees at the moment. Typically, the movement is bind to the arrow keys with the mouse being used for interacting with the in-game world and items. Spacebar is used for more specific actions like throwing. Button prompts appear on screen during the gameplay.

Generally resembling the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne, however, has some different mechanics and the pace of combat is increased thanks to the risk-rewarding battle system. Another difference is multiplayer, which comes in two kinds: you can summon other players into your game and fight bosses side by side or you can fight impostors, who are other players invading your playthrough.
Throughout the game, you are forced to explore an enormous open world of Yharnam, which looks like alternate universe Lovecraft-inspired Victorian-era England, as The Hunter.

WHAT&#39;S IN THE GAME?
- Addictingly tight and satisfying gameplay alongside a rich new story in the gothic dark fantasy style of Koji Igarashi, the celebrated godfather of &quot;Igavania&quot; games.
- A game soundtrack by genre and industry veteran Michiru Yamane, performed by a full live orchestra ensemble.
- Story cut scenes and NPC interactions fully voice acted by a star-studded cast, including actors like David Hayter, Ray Chase and Erica Lindbeck to name just a few. (Seriously, we have a lot of voice acting star power in this game, it&#39;s kinda nuts...)
- A total of three playable characters, two of which have yet to be revealed...
- Literally a metric ton of weapons and spells, which you can upgrade, level up and visually customize.
- Beautiful 2.5D graphics: 3D models crafted with a lot of love and care on a 2D game environment. That means lots of cool tricks that &quot;regular&quot; 2D can&#39;t do...

201,Chaos on Deponia,"The second game in the Deponia series is set in a whimsically cartoonish future world and is defined by its emphasis on characters and humor. Once again, the player controls Rufus, a selfish yet loveable rogue, who tries to leave his home planet Deponia and move to the luxurious space station Elysium. His cyborg girlfriend Goal got into trouble because of Rufus’s faults, and he has to save her. The plot, character interactions, and many jokes rely on the assumption that the player is already familiar with most characters from Deponia. However, in case you didn’t play the original game, there’s an introduction to familiarize you.
Chaos on Deponia uses point-and-click controls, which are usually better suited for mouses and keyboards. However, the developers claim to make sure that playing with a console’s controller is just as fluid and natural. The analog stick stands in for the mouse, while the buttons control various actions Rufus can do to objects and other characters. Like in most adventure games, the protagonist has to use various items to solve puzzles. Those are quite complex right from the start, and there’s no growing difficulty over the course of Chaos on Deponia.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6b/f6b1dafec8850cd3236402a48d3041ee.jpg

- selection of models of vehicles,
- salaries of drivers and other employees,
- expenses for the maintenance of transport,
- fare for different areas and categories of the population,
The reputation of the company also matters, it affects the preferences of passengers and, accordingly, on revenue and profits.
The route of each type of transport is constructed under certain conditions: for the tram rails are needed, for the metro you need a tunnel, a different number of stops for different areas. Residents are also divided into six classes, differing in income, needs and transport preferences.
The second game differs from the first by the absence of a helicopter as a mode of transport, the ability to build roads, the change of day and night, the introduction of depots instead of simple ring lines, and also the presence of a multi-player mode.
The player is provided with a data collection system that informs about people&#39;s places of residence and work, the functions of buildings, the number of stowaways and so on.

Gameplay
The game&#39;s heavily inspired by The Binding of Isaac, as stated by the developers.
Dead Cells features the procedurally generated environments that are typical for roguelike games, yet it puts a strong emphasis on exploration that is typically found in metroidvanias.
The players set out to explore the island where a prison was built.

Upon death, the players lose all the loot they had on them. It is possible to find a shopkeep somewhere in the dungeons to purchase new equipment or have some rest.

297,Forza Horizon 2,"The open world car racing simulator, part of the Forza game series, or rather the sequel to the Forza Horizon game, which was released in 2012. The game has a continuation - Forza Horizon 3.
Gameplay
In the story of the game, the player participates in the fictional Horizon racing festival, taking place in southern France and northern Italy.
The game world of Forza Horizon 2 is about three times larger than the world of the game Forza Horizon.
In total, the game has more than two hundred different cars, among which there are exotic, rally, trucks and &quot;hot&quot; hatchbacks. Among them: Lamborghini Huracán LP610-4 and Lamborghini Aventador in the version of Veneno, McLaren P1, LaFerrari, Koenigsegg Agera, Bugatti Veyron in the version of Sport.
Players explore the terrain in which the races take place, take part in races and other events - without all this, you cannot advance further in the game. Time of the day, day and night, were present in previous games, and in Forza Horizon 2 for the first time in the Forza Motorsport series a dynamic weather system was implemented.
To the modes of the game, known from previous games, new modes are added. For example, the Bucket List is a group of competitions, the result of which is taken into account for all group competitions in total. In multiplayer mode in the Bucket List, you can invite a friend or a random player, this mode has its own name Co-Op Bucket Lists.

298,Forza Horizon 3,"Forza Horizon 3 is a racing open-world game developed by Playground Games. It is a part of a large Forza series including 11 titles in it with Horizon 3 being the 9th heading in the row. It is, however, uncertain to claim that there is a unified narrative in racing games, so all 11 titles more likely represent one universe, but do not come in specific order.
As mentioned earlier, the title series does not follow a distinct storyline. Speaking of surroundings, nonetheless, it is safe to say, that the Horizon 3&#39;s scene is an Australia. The previous chapters of racing have pushed a narrative about the players being a participator of Horizon Festival. Now the protagonist becomes a host of the event, so they must play organizing roles, too. For example, hire drivers and adjust the racing grounds.
There are some events players can be a part of.  For example, drifting competition, Bucket List challenges and time trials. All of them utilize the same mechanics of getting to the finish line as fast as possible. There are more than 350 cars available, let alone DLC ones. 4-person co-op included along with multiplatform races between PC and Xbox One.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/30a/30afe3a3cb06849dc032ef3b9295f180.jpg

The Stranger was kept as a prisoner on an orbital station until he was released from his cell by an unknown benefactor wearing a bunny suit. The protagonist, now armed with a plasma gun and a katana, has to fight his way to freedom through a series of levels, each of them containing only one enemy, a boss who guards Stranger&#39;s prison. Each battle is preceded by a cutscene that further reveals the plot, and each boss requires a unique approach.
The game is played in an isometric top-down view. The combat system is very simple, it includes no combos and consists of only four basic movements. The Stranger can slash with his sword, fire his gun, block an incoming attack or dash forward to avoid it. Each action can be made more powerful by holding its button for several seconds, although it slows down your movement.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/556/556157feed9ee1f55f2b12b2973e30a3.jpg

314,Gods Will Be Watching,"Gods Will Be Watching is a point-and-click survival thriller. Deconstructeam have developed it, and it is the only title within the IP. The game was incipiently created within the Ludum Dare development competition, the theme of which was minimalism. That gradually affected the style of a final game build.
The story centers around the group of survivors questioned with a quest to survive during the 40 days being cut off from the outside world. The game&#39;s core feature is the variety of moral decision — the player decides who is worthy of sacrificing for the sake of the group&#39;s survival.
The gameplay features walking and talking with the other characters — six in total — while a heavy accent is made on time- and resource management. The game&#39;s name derives from the absence of right and wrong decisions: not only the survival of the team is a task at hand but the survival of an outside world from genocide.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4b/f4bfa7341a0445f8098ff7c6c4dca60f.jpeg

Many of the car systems that can be tuned in real life can be customized in the game - and the consequences for the behavior of the car in the game will be shown. For example, suspension settings affect handling.
The main mode of the game is arcade. But there is also a &quot;simulation&quot; mode that conducts the player through a series of races, constantly complicating the conditions and giving the player a chance to smoothly master the game, increase skill, earn game money for increasing the number of cars and other needs.
In Gran Turismo 5 there are 1031 cars, 26 locations and 71 variations of tracks. In addition, for the first time the editor of the tracks appeared in the game.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/dc1/dc19247b653958c45f0625a097d7623a.jpg

Throughout the story, the player will observe as the protagonist rises the ranks, sometimes making decisions of questionable nobility or profit. Our goal as a player is to ensure that Vercetti becomes the boss of all of Vice City’s mafia, and various story characters will help us or prevent us from achieving this goal.
The worlds of Grand Theft Auto series have long been worked upon and have been done in much detail, and Vice City is no different. The people on the sidewalks, the stylish cars and neon light clubs, the sky-high buildings and lively piers and beaches, everything will bring nostalgic feelings to those of players, whose eyes have seen the glory of this time. The gameplay, however, bears little difference from its predecessor, continuing the trend of big guns, explosions, and cop chases.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/13a/13a528ac9cf48bbb6be5d35fe029336d.jpg

In the course of each case, you’ll speak to witnesses, examine evidence and clues, and attempt to deduce the dastardly intent behind the crime before proceeding to the courtroom. In court, you will hear testimonies, cross-examine witnesses, and present evidence. And of course, it wouldn’t be an Ace Attorney game if you couldn’t shout “OBJECTION!” when you know you’ve got the facts and evidence needed to contradict the prosecution’s claims and prove your client’s innocence.
The game includes a convenient assistance feature in case you hit a dead end in your investigation, so even if this is your first Ace Attorney game, you can get into your amateur sleuthing adventures with ease!

""The Last Show of Mr. Chardish"" is a journey through the variety of worlds created by the ingenious mind of the successful Director, Robert Chardish. Take the role of Ella, the Actress and through exploring an old theatre try to unveil secrets hidden in the extraordinary, magical plays created in the imagination of Mr. Chardish.





When they were young, the Actress and the Director were full of dreams and ambitions. Decades later, the Actress returns to the theatre, to once more become the performer, the audience and the muse.


The performances, the letters and the radio interviews - they are all meaningful, but will the Actress find what she's looking for? Attend the last show of a famous artist reflecting on his defining moments and your role in his life. 





With each play you will explore a new, incredible scenography, fully painted in VR. Each performance tells the story of different characters, with individual gameplay mechanics and a unique closure. Be a robot escaping a factory or a little, boastful musketeer - every role you take is a medium for emotional experiences of the Director.




To separate the performances from the real world and put the stress on their artistic nature, we decided to reach for new, creative methods of graphic design. The plays’ segments of the game are painted using virtual reality technology. Exchanging traditional 3D modeling for painterly strokes and splatters granted us more expressive freedom in shaping the artistic vision of the Director.In The Last Show of Mr. Chardish you will experience:
A rich, engaging story about the relationship of two artists, who founded a theatre in a British countryside.Multiple chapters with different gameplay mechanics, telling individual stories tied to the main plot.A unique art style created with VR painting technology.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fb/4fb1d4e70e414b549ad68654a7fd5864.jpg

The dungeons are filled with intricate traps to evade, puzzles to solve, and hungry monsters to fight in real-time mode.

The player assumes control over a party of four customizable characters that are divided into three traditional D&amp;D classes (fighter, rogue, and mage) and four quite non-traditional races (besides Human, there are Minotaur, Lizardman, and Insectoid).

Plot
Clash of Heroes takes place in the medieval high fantasy world. It is set 40 years before the events depicted in Heroes of Might and Magic V. The game follows five heroes. Two of them already featured in HoM&amp;M V (Godric the knight and Anwen the elf), while three others are original (Aidan, who commands demons, a wizard Nadia and a necromancer Fiona). They oppose the demon lord who is searching for an artifact called Blade of Binding. He is going to use it to open the portal into his demon world and unleash his armies on Ashan.
Gameplay
In the campaign mode, the player assumes the role of one hero of his or her choice. Each hero represents one of the five traditional HoM&amp;M factions (humans, elves, demons, wizards, and the undead) and has his or her unique roster of units. Heroes navigate the map in real-time, but the battles are turn-based. Like in HoM&amp;M games, the heroes command their armies rather than fight on their own. The combat system, however, changed dramatically. In Clash of Heroes, it resembles a puzzle game of colored columns and rows. 
Multiplayer
There are both local and online multiplayer modes that allow two players to compete against each other, to cooperate against AI or the other team of two players.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/810/810c417f3b64d0f13935cdb7b7aa589d.jpg

Minecraft includes multiple modes that dramatically change the focus of the game. Survival and Adventure modes require the player to gather resources, hunt for food and fight monsters to survive. In the Hardcore mode, there’s even permanent death. Creative mode, by contrast, offers you to freely explore the world and construct whatever you want with unlimited resources. There’s also a multiplayer mode that allows the players to share their worlds and engage in the traditional MMO activities, such as player-vs-player combat.
Minecraft’s crude visual style, reminiscent of Lego cubes, became an iconic part of the popular culture. There are many myths and fan fiction surrounding the game, such as the legend of Herobrine, a rumored character that officially doesn’t exist.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/b4e/b4e4c73d5aa4ec66bbf75375c4847a2b.jpg

Your village was attacked by an Evil Samurai Warlord, who uses magic to turn the innocent animals into his loyal soldiers.

There are six playable characters, although Hiro is the default protagonist. Each of the ninjas has different skills and weapons. Some of the characters can use stealth to avoid the battle or to perform a wall-jump. There are also spells that allow you to fire lightning bolts at your opponents or to turn you into an animal for camouflage and sneaking. 
The game is full of visual staples about East Asia, such as traditional Japanese lanterns and hats, architecture, bamboo groves, pandas, masked ninjas, and armored samurai. The “chibi” (baby-like) design of the characters, along with their comically high-pitched voices, make all these look like a light-hearted parody rather than actual stereotypes. There are also elements of Japanese mythology such as Tengu, the friendly magic bird people, who trade with the character, provide training, and offer quests.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/157/1571cdfb52888191eabaf53c2b897240.jpg

Heavy Bomber Squadrons - Addition of German Arado and Allied B-24 Marauder heavy bomber units to air support
Infantry Mortar Launchers - Addition of infantry mortar units
Off-Map Heavy Artillery - Addition of heavy artillery strikes to the air support menu
Survival Mission Mode - New survival mission mode where you fend off waves of attacking enemies for as long as possible
About Order of War                  In the summer of 1944, the Second World War entered its end-game when the Allies launched two major operations that would drive back German forces on both the Western and Eastern Fronts at once.
Their names were Overlord and Bagration.  Overlord famously commenced with the D-Day landings in Normandy and ended in the Liberation of Paris, while Bagration - a far less well-known but far larger Russian operation - crushed the invading German forces in the east, leading to their complete withdrawal from Soviet territory.  Had either operation been unsuccessful, history could have been very different.
In the ultimate test of military strategy, Order of War will challenge you not only to lead America&#39;s finest to victory in the west, but also place you in command of the German forces charged with repelling the Red Army&#39;s seemingly unstoppable offensive in the east. Even the keenest military minds will find that it&#39;s one thing to make history, but quite another to change it.

416,Out There,"The plot
Earth, year 2138. Humanity is running out of space. You have been designed to explore the universe and colonize at least 10 new planets for your glorious empire!
Will you succeed? The fate of Humanity rests upon you.
How to play
The game has two phases :
First, when you are flying in space, you can use the WASD or the ZQSD or the ARROW keys to fly around. You can also use the SPACE key to shoot the asteroids passing by.To find other planets you must use your radar (green orbs around your ship shows both their direction and their distance to you).When trying to land on a planet, you must be careful not to go to fast and to have a good angle (watch out for warnings at the bottom of your screen)During your flight, you will consume your fuel and your spaceship's population will increase. The second phase is on the planets. You can move using the first phase's controlsWhen you land on a planet, you must plan carefully your moves : each moves will consume both food and population.On top of that, a city will be built behind you, you can't enter a town as it is too dense : each time you move you reduce the available space on the planet.

418,The Outer Worlds,"The Outer Worlds is a new single-player first-person sci-fi RPG from Obsidian Entertainment and Private Division.
In The Outer Worlds, you awake from hibernation on a colonist ship that was lost in transit to Halcyon, the furthest colony from Earth located at the edge of the galaxy, only to find yourself in the midst of a deep conspiracy threatening to destroy it. As you explore the furthest reaches of space and encounter various factions, all vying for power, the character you decide to become will determine how this player-driven story unfolds. In the corporate equation for the colony, you are the unplanned variable.
Key Features
The player-driven story RPG: In keeping with the Obsidian tradition, how you approach The Outer Worlds is up to you. Your choices affect not only the way the story develops; but your character build, companion stories, and end game scenarios.
You can be flawed, in a good way: New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you aren&#39;t particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures, but rewards you with an additional character perk immediately. This optional approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring Halcyon.
Lead your companions: During your journey through the furthest colony, you will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with unique abilities, these companions all have their own missions, motivations, and ideals. It&#39;s up to you to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your own ends.
Explore the corporate colony: Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy owned and operated by a corporate board. They control everything... except for the alien monsters left behind when the terraforming of the colony’s two planets didn’t exactly go according to plan. Find your ship, build your crew, and explore the settlements, space stations, and other intriguing locations throughout Halcyon.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/704/704f831d2d132e9614931f1c4eab9e86.jpg
419,Overwatch,"The Legacy
Overwatch is a multiplayer first-person shooter from the company that gave players the saga of Azeroth, Starcraft and the Diablo universe. Despite these releases coming out years ago, they are still alive and actively updated. But the developers at Blizzard wanted something new: the company does not like to experiment with new settings, preferring to transfer existing characters to new genres, worlds, and situations. The exception, perhaps, can only be a game about the three Vikings—The Lost Vikings, but this, too, was a long time ago.
The story and setting
Anyway, the company Blizzard has approached the development of Overwatch with team-specific meticulousness to details and desire to create an elaborative game universe. The player faces a choice between 21 characters who were part of the elite Overwatch unit. The task of Overwatch soldiers is to protect the Earth from conflicts and external threats. But something goes wrong, and the team of heroes breaks up. Despite the multiplayer bias, the game has a full story, it combines all the characters and maps on which the battle takes place. Since the launch, seven new characters have been added to the hero pool. Blizzard tells the story of the world of Overwatch through their characters: almost everyone has an animated short film, comparable in quality to a full meter from, for example, Pixar.
Continuous support
The game won the hearts of players around the world immediately after the launch. The figures confirm this fact: more than half a million dollars from sales and more than 40 million players. Overwatch has become an anchor project for Activision Blizzard, and the company continues to develop the project two years later, constantly offering players new maps, new characters, new themed events, and new cosmetic skins.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/4ea/4ea507ceebeabb43edbc09468f5aaac6.jpg

When his homeland was attacked by pirates, Otus starts an adventure to protect his home and reveal the secrets of his race. He makes new friends on the way. Each of them has special powers, useful during fights.
Owlboy features classic platforming gameplay with a twist: unlike in many hardcore games of this genre, here you can fly and have almost no chance to die by falling. Otus can pick things up and use them as weapons or to solve puzzles. There are several ways to complete the same missions; your choice depends on your imagination only. Also, there are suitable tactics for different enemy types: while you can defeat some of them with direct force, the others can be destroyed in more creative ways.
The game’s world is organized like a huge cylinder with Otus’ village on the bottom; during the game you will fly higher and higher. Missions are set in separate locations; after completing them you will return to the central hub to get new quests.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0fc/0fc933e3dfbbf4306840ef429d73fa9a.jpg

429,The Procession to Calvary,"A time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace. Ecclesiastes 3:8About
Huzzah! The holy war is over! Your oppressors have been vanquished, the churches of the Old God lay in ruin and thousands of innocent people have been murdered! But it&#39;s not all good news; the tyrant Heavenly Peter has escaped your clutches, and you have been tasked with the mission of finding him...
Your journey will take you through a richly detailed landscape built from hundreds of different Renaissance paintings. You will steal a ship, feed a donkey, compete in a talent contest, assist an inept street magician, sing, dance, play the (magic?) flute, poke a man&#39;s face, hunt for treasure and have a chat with Our Lord God Almighty... But will you find Heavenly Peter? And if you do, how will you take your revenge!?Features
Pointing and Clicking – A traditional point and click interface, with a &#39;verb coin&#39; interaction menu and a simple inventory from which you can drag and drop your preciously hoarded items.
Renaissance Artwork –  Paintings by Rembrandt, Botticelli, Michelangelo and many more are brought together into one consistent world, in a way that is also as sympathetic as possible to the original works.
Classical Music – a soundtrack selected to fit with the style of the artwork. Music from classical composers such as Vivaldi, Bach and George Frideric Handel will accompany you on your journey.
Standalone Story - The Procession to Calvary is set in the same world as Four Last Things, but it&#39;s story can be played independently.
Optional Murder – You will be equipped with a sword. This will become useful in a number of different situation, but you will be strongly discouraged from using it on people. Ignoring this advice - and murdering anyone who stands in your way – will serve as a useful method of skipping any puzzles you don&#39;t like. But be warned; your actions might come back to haunt you...
Nonsense – A style of humour reminiscent of the surreal, anarchic comedy of Monty Python. Lofty subject matter is treated with refreshing flippancy. Gags about butts are taken very seriously. But rest assured, while some of the jokes may be ridiculous, the puzzles make perfect sense! (or at least adhere to a consistent internal logic)
Moments of Surprising Profundity – Actually, no... Don&#39;t read too much into it.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/437/437ef2730e0b5efb3a268ea2c7e7c7c0.jpg

The setting
The action takes place in a city called New York Zero, where an epidemic is raging, and its territory is divided into zones.

Key features
Cruel and bloody Prototype 2 is the second game of the series. It seems that, compared to the first part, the gory feel is becoming bigger. The game is allowing you to run and jump almost anywhere and do whatever the player wants - anarchy! But despite the fact that the game takes place in an open world, a player can feel some linearity of events. According to lead designer Matt Armstrong, this was done purposefully so that the player would feel the development of the storyline and wouldn’t be afraid of too many options, and have the opportunity to open new territories gradually, thereby more effectively upgrading his character and immerse in the game’s universe.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/445/44507fdd60a8ec02b1c3c64a293ca754.jpg

443,Red Dead Redemption,"Red Dead Redemption is a third-person open-world adventure game which implements the Wild West at its best: it is very much GTA-clone but in bizarre stylistics and the very beginning of the twentieth century. This is the second title of a franchise, being preceded by Red Dead Revolver and followed by Red Dead Redemption 2 coming out in late 2018. 
We play as John Marston who gradually takes down and take out criminals and those, who crosses his path. Among the combat mechanics, the most interesting one is &quot;Dead Eye&quot; — it allows one to point multiple targets out in slow motion and then shoot them simultaneously. 
The game features 16-players multiplayer and cooperative and also has zombie DLC — Undead Nightmare. Additional content adds two modes to the original game: undead overrun in which you have to survive an infinite amount of zombie waves, and Land Grab in which player has to defend the particular piece of land to gain control of it.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/686/686909717c3aa01518bc42ae2bf4259e.jpg

After a robbery goes badly wrong in the western town of Blackwater, Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang are forced to flee. With federal agents and the best bounty hunters in the nation massing on their heels, the gang must rob, steal and fight their way across the rugged heartland of America in order to survive. As deepening internal divisions threaten to tear the gang apart, Arthur must make a choice between his own ideals and loyalty to the gang who raised him.
From the creators of Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an epic tale of life in America at the dawn of the modern age.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/511/5118aff5091cb3efec399c808f8c598f.jpg

446,République,"At long last, République: Episode 5: Terminus is finally here! All of us at Camouflaj are anxious to finally release the fifth and final chapter of République. To all of you who waited patiently for the series conclusion, we deeply appreciate your patience and support. The team here at Camouflaj put our hearts and souls into this epic final episode -- we hope you agree that it was worth the wait.
Just as we did with previous episodes, Episode 5: Terminus is not just an additional chapter but it comes with thousands of fixes and enhancements. Here’s a breakdown of the major changes we made in addition to adding the fifth episode:
Improved performance, crash frequency, and optimized framerate for lower-end devices
Resolved issue where Hope falls out of the game world on some machines with AMD graphics cards
Fixed issues regarding Hope’s trouble retrieving the EP3 cassette at beginning of episode, near desk in Reception Area
Unity default typeface no longer appears by default in certain prefabs (English alphabet only)
Improved and revised navigation, pathfinding, and collision in Episode 1-3
Improved camera rotation limits and view in all episodes
UI and pop-up improvements in all episodes
Updated 2D art for some scannable items in Episode 1-3
In addition to the upgrades we’ve made, here is some of the new stuff you can expect in Episode 5 (without spoiling too much):
Hostile Cameras: These new security cameras scattered throughout the game world will scan Hope and alert guards to her presence. Players can only inhabit them for a limited time, adding a neat layer of complexity to the gameplay loop.
Branching Paths: This is something we’ve kept close to the vest for a long time: EP5 has branching paths that change the course of the episode based on a decision you make early on. We don’t want to reveal too much, but this is a huge addition that greatly expands the content offered in Episode 5, offering a nice incentive to play through the campaign again.
A New Metamorphosis: Players are returning to the world of some previous episodes, but will find it looking and feeling much differently than before. You’re going to see new areas, meet new enemies, and forge some interesting alliances…
We want to say more, but it’s better if you to experience it for yourself!
When you’re done with the game, I encourage you to check out our final installment of The Making of République (available now in the Deluxe Edition), and take a look back on the production of this massive, four year endeavor. We’ve prided ourselves on giving you a window into our world by providing open and honest in-game developer commentary tracks, and these video documentaries are an extension of that. You might even see some old footage from back when we were younger, healthier, and less sleepy.
Finally, we want to give a shout out to composer Zinc Lemone for his work on Episode 5’s soundtrack (also included with the Deluxe Edition.) I’ve had some standout favorite tracks in previous episodes, but EP5’s soundtrack in simply incredible from start to finish. (“Loose Change” is the JAM y’all.)
Watching Episode 5’s final moments come to life this past year has been bittersweet. It’s hard to believe that we are finally at the finish line after first announcing the game back in 2012. We owe a lot to our initial Kickstarter backers, our publishing friends at GungHo Online Entertainment, and our stellar voiceover cast including Rena Strober, Jennifer Hale, David Hayter, Dwight Schultz, and Khary Payton. It’s not an exaggeration to say that République is the product of thousands of people coming together and making it a reality.
Thank you all, from the bottom of our hearts. It’s been an incredible journey.Camouflaj",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/24a/24ae7b19348ee1becc480ddc8ed8549a.jpg

The city is in the throes of an outbreak, with the shuffling undead wandering the streets and the urban jungle becoming a tangle of overturned cars and crumbling buildings. Picturesque, isn’t it? It’s against this backdrop that Jill Valentine prepares to make her escape, though there’s a bit of a twist in the timeline for those of you who aren’t familiar with the original. If you played Resident Evil 2 earlier this year, you may know that Leon and Claire arrived in the city on September 29th. Jill’s story, however, starts a few days earlier. As an accomplished member of S.T.A.R.S. and a survivor of the incident in the Arklay Mountains (the site of the original Resident Evil), Jill has some experience with the horrors that await.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a4b/a4bb55f42fe837ae7bf1307e7b41cc85.jpg
449,Resident Evil 6,"Bioterrorism ... Terrorists infect the US President with a vaccine that makes him an aggressive zombie. And one of the heroes of the game will have to kill him. Behind the terrorists, there is a mafia organisation that wants to hide the truth about the impossibility to control the biological weapons developed by it, which turns people into zombies. Bioterrorists opposed by a detachment of special forces - it serves two other characters.
The action of the game periodically turns from a personal vendetta into a global catastrophe and back. One President-zombie is replaced by whole cities of infected. Zombies and mutants, bioterrorists, special forces and mercenaries - they all act constantly, fight and survive in open territories and secret bases.
In total, you can play for seven characters, including a woman - the head of terrorists. Four story campaigns, after going through one line of the plot, you can choose another lens and see the events from a different perspective.
There are many enemies, but ammunition drops out of them after death. The more dangerous is the enemy, the more ammo is dropped. In hand-to-hand combat, various combo attacks help. The complete passage of the game is described as approximately 25 hours of pure action.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f6f/f6f39c5b56413f7f4513b25989a1b747.jpg
450,Resident Evil 7: Biohazard,"Resident Evil 7: Biohazard is the latest installment in the Resident Evil series. For 13 long years, Resident Evil series were rejecting the survival-horror aspect and atmosphere of first original games in the series mainly released in nineties on PlayStation one system. From the famous Resident Evil 4 until Resident Evil 6, the series went full-force into action genre leaving horror elements behind and hard-core fans disappointed. Finally, Capcom realized that Resident Evil needs a change and Resident Evil 7: Biohazard delivers those changes at its fullest. First of all, the camera angle changed from over the shoulder view into first-person mode. Another change is that survival-horror elements are back together with light puzzle solving, inventory management and maze-like mansion in which the main story of the game happens. The player controls Ethan Winters who is searching for his lost wife in a dark mansion filled with horrible creatures and insane family. 
Resident Evil 7: Biohazard can also be played with virtual reality setup and it’s known as one of the best games which supports VR.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/cee/cee577e2097a59b77193fe2bce94667d.jpg

From the author:
Goals
I want to challenge myself so this&#39;ll be a very different game from anything I&#39;ve done before, including Papers Please. There&#39;ll be less creativity with the gameplay and instead I want to experiment with the rendering, story, and a few technical features. Right now I have only a rough idea about the narrative. I&#39;m hoping to capture a compelling mystery with suspense and twists in the limited space of an old merchant sailing ship. It won&#39;t be the typical &quot;collect items and look for clues&quot; structure. There&#39;s a slightly cool gameplay hook but I won&#39;t go into details on that until much later.
Devlog
I&#39;ll try to keep this (https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=40832.0) devlog lively as I make progress. Because the gameplay itself is more standard, there probably won&#39;t be as many creative updates as the Papers Please devlog. I will post lots of pictures and builds as soon as I&#39;m able. Things will likely also move slower than Papers Please did too, at least at the start. P,P still takes a good amount of my time so there&#39;s less chance for me to maintain a laser-like focus on one project like last time. The lower bound for finishing this game is around 3 months but realistically I think it&#39;ll take me around half a year. My Maya skills are pretty rusty so I expect the modeling/animation to take the most time.
1-bit Rendering
My first computer was a Mac Plus. I&#39;ve always had a nostalgia-softened spot in my heart for 1-bit graphics. I&#39;d like to capture the detailed black &amp; white look of old Mac games in a realtime 1st person game. I plan to push it grittier and less cartoon-like than those old games; the hard part will be keeping everything legible without it becoming an unreadable mess of dithered pixels. One interesting problem with 1-bit rendering is that it doesn&#39;t scale well for images and it compresses to video like shit - so YouTube stuff may look really poor. We&#39;ll see how it goes.
Unity 3D
I&#39;m gonna use Unity for this one. I fell in love with Haxe/OpenFL on my last project but unfortunately the 3D situation is not that great there yet. Also, it&#39;s time to finally see why 90% of the indie scene is using Unity. I have a good amount of experience with 3D games and the few days I&#39;ve played around with Unity so far have been pretty productive. The animated title screen scene up there (with post-processing shaders and all) was created in one day. I now have unrealistically high hopes.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/052/052f9afc7aaeea3e2c5d46eafa92c64e.jpg

Your desperate battle against forces beyond comprehension will haunt you until the end. Physical combat will be challenging, spellcasting will have dire consequences, and your sanity will be strained to the breaking point by unknown abominations. Sometimes the best solution will be to flee what lurks beyond the threshold.
Features:
A hand drawn 2D world reflecting Lovecraft&#39;s themes of cosmic horror and dread.
Enemies, environments and storylines inspired by Lovecraft’s iconic original works. Take part in quests inspired by your favorite stories and see them play out according to your own decisions and role-playing style.
Choose from 8 main character Archetypes, each with its own origin backstory and specialties.
A host of weird companions will accompany you on your ill-starred journey: the lonely, antediluvian &#39;Outsider&#39;, a fallen soldier of the Great War reanimated by Herbert West, a psychic (and narcissistic) cat from Ulthar. Recruit these and other outlandish beings to your crew.
Your character&#39;s Sanity and mental state will influence dialogue options. Mental illness comes with advantages as well as hindrances. Sometimes it pays to be mad in a world gone mad!
Stygian&#39;s Belief System determines how your characters cope with the warped reality of the new Arkham, as well as the rate at which they regenerate lost Sanity. Belief Systems also offer unique dialogue options, expanding the breadth of role-playing possibilities.
A new kind of spell system which sometimes takes more than it gives. Being a master of the occult is not as simple as flinging colored missiles from your fingertips. The black magic of Stygian is potent but may cost you your mind, your health, and possibly even much more.
Strategic, turn-based combat from a 2D perspective, similar to the classic Heroes of Might and Magic games.
The struggle in Stygian is not to save the world, for that battle is lost already. Pursue your own goals in these end times: salvation, vendetta, or perhaps something darker.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f8/3f84564e93bea37d56f14f62db256bbb.jpg

The player is eliminated when he or she loses all lives.
Multiplayer
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate includes several competitive multiplayer modes. Besides the traditional versus mode, there are several new modes not featured in the previous games.

508,Tearaway,"Tearaway is a 3D platformer set in the world where everything is made out of the paper. It is the only title within the franchise. The remake for home consoles Tearaway: Unfolded, was released two years after the initial game.
Gameplay
The player takes a role of either Atoy or Yota — a male or a female character correspondingly and goes out for an adventure to deliver a letter to the outside world — personally in the hands of the player himself. The gameplay involves all of PS Vita specials: the rear touchpad, microphone, and both cameras.
The only obstacles in the way of the player are scraps — little papercraft creatures emerging from the ground from time to time.
There are drums, for instance, that bounce the papercraft protagonist into the air while the player snaps a rear touchpad. Moreover, the photos of a real environment can be used to decorate some of the in-game&#39;s elements — to sum up; one may stick as many stickers to the ground making the world look like his own. Some of the obstacles during the playthrough may be overcome by player blowing into the microphone and creating wind consequently by this. 
Key features
The plot regularly breaks the fourth wall — a protagonist delivers a message directly to the player, and the latter has many means of communicating with him.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/91f/91f3cdc8fe08ea2585a37ee3846ffdcd.jpg

At the beginning of the game, the player chooses one out of two characters. The choice does not affect gameplay whatsoever, only the look of your character. The main feature of the game is the interaction with the environment using the features of the DualShock 4. The players go through a world that is completely made out of paper. Your playable character can jump, grab and roll.
In order to progress through the game, the player has to modify the surroundings so new paths can be opened.

Once upon a time, there were two races on Earth: monsters and humans, but a war broke out between them and the latter won.

A lot of time passed since the war, but a human child accidentally falls down the mountain. Its goal is to get back out.
Undertale uses pixelated graphics and traditional mechanics of RPGs such as earning experience points, having an open world, and so on.

The battles in the game are represented using the bullet hell mini-games with the player having an option to choose where they want to spare their opponent or hit the enemy back.

Set in the alternate 1961 where Nazi Germany won World War II, the game picks up right at the end of Wolfenstein: The New Order. After sustaining heavy injuries in the battle with Wilhelm &quot;Deathshead&quot; Strasse, BJ Blaskowicz orders a nuclear strike on Deathshead&#39;s compound in order to cripple the Nazi war machine, but he is evacuated by his comrades before the rocket launch. Blaskowicz falls unconscious for 5 months and is woken up by a Nazi attack. The player has to repel the attack and end the Nazi reign over America once and for all.

600,Anomaly 2,"Anomaly 2 is a sequel to Anomaly: Warzone Earth and the third part in the Anomaly mobile game series. Anomaly series inverted the classic tower defense genre to create an innovative &quot;tower offense&quot; type of strategy.
Plot
The game is set in the post-apocalyptic near future, sometime after the alien invasion of Earth that was described in Anomaly: Warzone Earth. By 2034, our planet is devastated and mostly covered with ice. The last remnants of humanity are trying to defeat the invading alien machines, who stay besieged in their highly fortified bases.
Gameplay
Like its predecessors, Anomaly 2 puts the player in control of a convoy of armored vehicles. The goal of each mission is to fight your way through the enemy territory that is protected with defense towers and units. The game has no construction options or resource mining, but there are repair zones on each level. They allow the player to upgrade, purchase, or sell his or her units right in the middle of a mission. Anomaly 2 introduces a new gameplay option: morphing. All vehicles have more than one shape and can morph into different units with unique abilities.
Multiplayer
Anomaly 2 is the first game in the series to introduce multiplayer. This mode allows playing as either humans or alien machines. Humans gameplay is the same as in single mode. Playing for the alien side, however, completely changes the game and turns it into the tower defense where the player&#39;s goal is to withstand the siege.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1d0/1d01242356819c4cdd0f1a4baa46bd37.jpeg

As the head of an investigation team, you need to explore the anomalies happening around the parts of the ship and find out the information about the catastrophe. As the section of the spacecraft landed in several cities, game events take place around the world.

Plot
Like the original Battlefield, the game is based on the real events of World War II. The game focuses on the obscure battles of the war. It features storylines that tie the battles together and consist of episodes called “war stories”.
Gameplay
Battlefield V puts a strong emphasis on realism. The game avoids video game abstractions in favor of immersive experience of the war. For that goal, the game aims to increase the player&#39;s interaction with the environment, such as doors, vehicles, or ammo. The ammo and other resources in the game are scarce, forcing the player to use a tactical approach.
The game gives a spotlight to women in the military who are among the main characters in the campaign. The player might also choose to play a female character in the multiplayer, as the gender is not tied to a class. The game also allows the players many customization options for costumes, vehicles, and weapons.
Modes
Battlefield V has many multiplayer modes, some of which are new to the series and some are reimagined versions of the modes from previous games. For example, The Grand Operations mode is based on the original Battlefield mode called Operations. This mode imitates a military campaign and consists of a series of battles with different objectives and non-linear progress options.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/45b/45b57ed59de4b84effd8f6bc4b7bf515.jpg

Besides plot-driven single-player campaign, there&#39;s also multiplayer that allows five different modes. All characters are divided into four classes: Assault, Engineer, Medic, and Recon.

645,Beat Hazard,"Beat Hazard is a game in which everything is synchronized to your favorite music. Gameplay-wise, it’s a regular 2D shoot ’em up in space, not unlike Asteroids or Project Starfighter. The player controls a small starship that fires at everything on the screen, from asteroids to enemy spacecraft, in order to survive. When hit by an obstacle or by enemy fire, the ship explodes. The goal is to survive as long as possible and score more points to unlock bonuses and receive ranks.
What makes gameplay in Beat Hazard innovative is that every level is based on a song from the player’s music collection. The song defines the speed and rhythm of the game. A similar approach was previously used in Audiosurf, but never before in a shoot ’em up. Enemy attacks, your ship’s fire, and power-ups are synchronized to the song and can be predicted if you remember the tune well. The difficulty is also dependent on music. A power ballad or an ambient piece will do for a slow, meditative play, while a trance or heavy metal composition will turn the game into madness. The game’s visuals are very bright and feature many rapid flashes, which makes Beat Hazard not recommended for people with epilepsy.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c7/3c7d83613049dbdc87b34904a739ddbc.jpg

651,Betrayer,"Betrayer is a first-person horror game developed by Blackpowder Games. 
Plot
The game is set in the 17th-century state of Virginia. The protagonist awakes on a shore with no memory of the events leading him here. He goes to Fort Henry which appears to be completely abandoned. The whole colony is actually abandoned, yet there are hostile beings whose bodies consist of burning embers. The protagonist goes on to seek answers about what actually happened in the colony.
Gameplay
Betrayer heavily relies on stealth in its gameplay. There are no clear paths or objective for the players to follow. This was made specifically to deprive the players of any sense of direction and encourage exploration of a monochrome game world. It is essential to listen to specific sounds in the game, as some of them will guide the players towards a clue or an important item. The clues are documented and put in your inventory upon picking them up. 
Upon encountering the enemies, the best strategy for the player is to hide in the high grass, spectate the enemy movement and pick the right moment to execute a stealth kill. Sound plays an important role here too, as any sound the players make in the grass will attract some unwanted attention, so it is essential to time your movement with the wind gusts. The players have access to a wide variety of weapons, such as pistols, muskets, tomahawks, and bows. Upon death, the players leave all their items at the place of death and can retrieve them.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/830/8308df0cd9b070e63c13b4392b57d8a8.jpg

654,Beyond: Two Souls,"This game is often called an &quot;interactive film&quot; - because the proportion between the given story and the possibilities to influence the story is indeed somewhat different than in most games. The game develops between three points in the biography of the girl Jodie Holmes. In these three points, we find ourselves repeatedly. And in general, we see 16 years of her life, from 8 to 24 years.
Jodie from birth has a gift of communication with a disembodied being called Aiden. In this context, the Jodie-Aiden couple can capture people&#39;s consciousness, move objects, and even strangle people. At the same time, Jodie is periodically exposed to attacks of vague energies.
Her parents are not her relatives, they give her to psychiatrists and refuse her. When the family of one of the psychiatrists perishes, Jodie, with the help of Ayden, establishes a connection with the deceased, she can let the living and the dead speak.
The CIA is interested in Jodie&#39;s abilities and makes her become an agent. She then instructs her on several missions, but Jodie realises that she is being used for criminal activities - and refuses to cooperate with the CIA. CIA agents do not leave her alone, and she destroys them.
The game has a lot of interpretations of what is happening in the world of the dead, different people use Jodi&#39;s forces in different ways. Jody herself also does not have a clear picture, she seeks and finds real parents, helps different people - but they rarely pay her the same.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/07a/07a74470a2618fd71945db0619602baf.jpg

A few years have passed since our heroes heroically defeated the arch-witch Mortroga. And their lives, like the lives of most people in Aventásia, are still in turmoil. The War of the Two Towers is over, but the wounds it left upon the land are still bleeding.
The gnome Wilbur Weathervane is struggling with his new job as a teacher at the reopened School for Wizardry and Witchcraft. His magic wand is having a mind of its own and an assassination plot against the arch-mage overshadows the first democratic elections in Seastone.
Faced with political intrigues that threaten the delicate balance of peace, Wilbur is in dire need of his old friends. But the elf princess Ivo and the adventurer Nate have, after a brief romantic interlude, gone their separate ways.
Ivo has returned to her gilded cage in the elf kingdom, overprotected by her controlling mother.
Nate along with his trusty companion Critter has been taken prisoner on the flying island of his arch-enemy the Red Pirate.
But fate does not rest. A darkness has fallen upon the land, or rather, a pinkness. A magic force is turning mighty beasts into fluffy plush puppies and towering castles into oversized dollhouses.

677,Bound,"In Bound, the player takes on the role of a dancing lady in a surreal imaginary world.
Plot
The game serves as a metaphor for pregnancy. The frame story explains that the game is set in a world imagined by a pregnant woman who fantasizes about being a princess in another world. This princess is the main protagonist, and she follows the quest her mother Queen gave her. There&#39;s a monster that tries to destroy the Queen&#39;s kingdom. The character&#39;s goal is to find a way to defeat the monster. 
Gameplay
In the prologue, the player controls the pregnant woman in the real world. In the main game, the player assumes the role of the dancing princess. Her movements, such as jumps and rolls, resemble that of ballet dancers and gymnasts. Most of the game consists of the protagonist navigating the world, jumping platforms, walking tightropes and climbing, with few occasional fights. An Edge Guard system ensures that the protagonist cannot fall from most platforms. At the few selected locations, the protagonist can fall to her death and respawn.
Style
Bound features a notably colorful and surreal visual style. The environment around the protagonist consists of geometric shapes that change in constant motion. Locations often reflect certain aspects in the life of the frame story protagonist. The game is set to electronic ambient music.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/9bd/9bdb0abe91e00389fb6b3225f414f695.jpg

However, the solution is sought precisely by turning over, rotating and other unusual, impossible actions with all this.

During the levels Bros fight against terrorists in the setting of games of the 80s to rescue other Bros. The gameplay features special combat mechanics: each Bro has two different attacks (first is constant and endless, while the second requires recharging) and a melee weapon to climb the obstacles. However, enemies can be also defeated by using distracting maneuvers. Bros also have special abilities like parkour skill or explosion resistance. The level can be completed only if another Bro is rescued, terrorists with their boss are eliminated, and the American flag is set on the enemies’ base.

695,Call of Juarez: Gunslinger,"Gunslinger is the fourth installment of the Call of Juarez series of western-inspired games. The frame story, told in cutscenes, begins in 1910, in Kansas, where Silas, a patron in the pub, brags about his adventures in the Wild West. This old man claims he used to be a bounty hunter who took down many of the famous outlaws. Most of the game has the player re-enacting Silas&#39;s presumed past, while in the present the hero is narrating his own story off-screen. Silas is an unreliable narrator, however, and his own in-game audience will point at plot holes in his tall tales. 
Like the rest of Call of Juarez games, Gunslinger has every classic staple of the western genre. There are saloons and gold mines, stagecoaches, Indians and cowboys, sheriffs and gangs. The protagonist will escape prison, wander the Wild West, fight brigands and other enemies using a variety of late XIX century firearms, and occasionally sing country songs. Gunfights and duels are the central features of the game. There&#39;s even a Duel mode, in which the player can enter a tournament of gun duels, and the Arcade mode, in which multiple opponents attack the player. Gunslinger also introduces quick time events that allow the player to evade bullets.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a86/a86ce0afaf2d5ec2b0f048989f01795e.jpg

These 21st century soldiers are equipped much better than their 1994 predecessors. They have 8 types of machinery, suitable for land, surface and airborne operations, as well as 17 types of weapon from assault rifles to the nuclear bomb.
Skirmishes take place all around the world and even in space! You'll fight throughout the day and night, in hot and cold weather, in snow and rain. The enemy is skilled - there're terrorists from all over the world and they have cutting-edge technologies at their disposal: teleportation and various mechanized combat systems. Our heroes will face great challenges - artillery strikes, insuperable force fields, automated turrets, suicide soldiers and giant humanoid robots.
Your savvy will come in handy: your actions aren't limited to slaughter and destruction. You'll have to capture enemy vehicles and bases, save hostages and rescue convicts, hold the line and shoot back from the turrets, search for data discs and spare parts, repair broken robots and bypass minefields. The high command carefully watches your operation’s progress: missions can be aborted because of major offence; minor misbehavior will be reprimanded, and great achievements will be rewarded with medals and promotions. In the end, the very best soldiers will receive the greatest reward: they will return to home camp where warm army barracks, hot army food, soft army bunks and a tender drill sergeant await them. Until the next time.

8 types of controllable machinery
17 types of weaponry, including tactical nuclear strikes and carpet bombings
Battles with unique bosses

715,City of Brass,"Become a daring thief in City of Brass, a punishing first-person, Arabian Nights-themed rogue-lite. Armed with scimitar and a whip that can grab, trip, disarm, stun or shatter as well as swing, players will lash and slash, bait and trap their way through hordes of undead, making it to each level’s exit before the Sands of Time run out, collecting treasures and looting chests for weapon and armour upgrades or powerful relics on the way. But the city itself also has teeth. Players will have to leap across pits, slide under blades, avoid spears or arrows, evade or employ sprung paving slabs, and skirt round poison gas traps – all the while manipulating these dangers to their advantage against enemies.

Incarcerated within the city are genies, most of them friendly, who will barter benefits in return for loot or grant wishes for a powerful advantage – or for a ransom, free them to secure their help in the final battle.

Joining him are a number of high profile guests, including Napoleon Bonaparte and President of the newly-formed United States of America, George Washington. The strange nature of this private reception goes beyond just the prestigious guests –Richet’s own mother has recently gone missing on the island, while each and every one of the colorful cast seems to have their own hidden agendas.

During confrontations, skills and limited resources can be used to gain the upper hand and achieve the desired outcome. Players will be rewarded for their knowledge of each character’s psychological vulnerabilities and immunities, as well as their preparations made during prior exploration and investigation. Failing an encounter does not mean ‘game over’, and no action can be taken back. The consequences are permanent, and may result in persistent physical disfigurements or mental traits that help or hinder the rest of the player’s adventure.
Richet’s numerous skills can be developed to align with your chosen approach to the adventure. Solve issues with diplomacy, delve into occultism to expand your historical and scientific knowledge, or play detective and see what others do not perceive. Your skills will have uses that extend far beyond your conversations with fellow guests. With 15 diverse skills to use and invest in, players are free to uncover The Council’s mysteries how they see fit, with wildly varying consequences depending on their methods.

Thirty years ago in the mid-2040s the sweeping development of neuroscience stirred up the common anticipation of victory over aging and death. In 2047 the scientists of the Neurocopying Institute in Cologne run the first experiments on transferring human consciousness onto an artificial carrier. In the course of experiments a weird previously unregistered phenomenon was discovered - the copies of neurotic system of the test subjects awoken in the computational device began to self-destroy by immersing in a state of deep irrational fear.
The discovery of the mysterious phenomenon induced a string of events to have completely changed the society. Dozens of years later the question of the ‘Panic Attack’ nature still remains open. We do not know how far the researchers’ thought has led them in search of the answer, but we believe it hardly ever visited this Mongolian steppe.
Year 2076, Mongolia. You wake up in a yurt amidst the boundless steppes. You neither remember your name, nor are aware of how long you had slept. Who are you? Who is this mechanical girl sitting on the table and what is the number she has on her chest? Nearby there towers the dome of a neglected entertainment park. How did it appear in these desert lands?

Plot
The game is set in the world after the literal Biblical Apocalypse that involved the Four Horsemen and a battle between angels and demons. The story of Darksiders III unfolds at the background of the events of two original games. Darksiders III follows Fury, a Horsewoman of the Apocalypse and the sister to the original protagonist, War the Horseman. She goes on a quest given to her by the Charred Council, an institution that is meant to keep the balance between Heaven, Hell, and Earth. Fury&#39;s mission is to find and annihilate the infamous Seven Deadly Sins. The mighty Lord of the Hollows agrees to help her, although he&#39;s obviously pursuing his own goals. He gives Fury the power of the flame.

She can also shape-shift into several forms based on elements, such as the flame. Fury also has to solve puzzles and jump platforms.

However, this power came at a tragic cost: the Horsemen were ordered to use their newfound strength to wipe out the rest of their kind.  What followed was a bloody battle on Eden where the Horsemen, obeying the will of the Council, annihilated the Nephilim.
Still reeling from the events on Eden, WAR and STRIFE have been given a new assignment -- LUCIFER, the enigmatic and deceptive demon king, has been plotting to upset the Balance by granting power to master demons throughout Hell.  War and Strife must hunt down these masters, gather information, and ultimately fight their way through a tangled, demonic conspiracy that threatens to forever upset the Balance and unravel all of creation.

Features
More complex story with no knowledge of the previous storyline necessary: If you haven&#39;t played Dead Age you will still be able to follow the diverse story of Dead Age 2 without difficulty.
Improved combat system (Final Fantasy X meets Darkest Dungeon): with fast-paced yet strategic battles and use of up to 24 skills
Faction Reputation System: Increase your standing with the three major factions to reap rewards and improve trade
3D Base-Management: Assign tasks to survivors, craft items and expand you camp&#39;s capabilities for improved crafting options

10 years after the initial outbreak of the zombie apocalypse, the members of Jack&#39;s camp fled to Freedom City, where a cure for the zombie plague was developed. But the news brings more suffering than relief. New factions have sprung up in the region, in constant battle for dominance. The merciless Military, the shady Smugglers and the Independents made up primarily of civilians.
When an Independents&#39; refugee camp was overrun by an undead horde, the few survivors struggle for food and valuable resources in an unforgiving world, always looking over their shoulder for gangs of looters and the flesh-eating dead.
While the big advantage of Dead Age&#39;s turn-based combat system versus tactics-based games is faster progression, the mechanics have evolved.
A character can now bring up to 24 skills to the battle. Change up your tactics mid-fight to instantly gain the advantage over zombies and hostile survivors. Place front-row combatants to protect ranged-combat allies from attackers, and deploy turrets, hunting dogs and tigers, as well as an array of new weapons.
Visit the outposts of other factions to trade and take on missions and improve your standing with them. Improving relations with the region&#39;s greater factions unlocks  better equipment and plot devices. A negative reputation can lead to confrontation or even a bounty.
Your 3D base is your central hub of operations. Here, you assign crafting or building jobs to survivors, build and upgrade stations to improve defense and quality of life and unlock improved craftable items and higher yield of resources.
The new open game-world offers free exploration of the world map with over 80 detailed graphically depicted locations. Beside nature scenes, Dead Age 2 features new indoor locations like hospitals, bunkers, schools, malls and army supply stores.
Decisions you make while playing can have significant effects on the progression of the story involving the three survivor factions, romanceable characters, and bring you closer to one of the game&#39;s six endings!
Like its predecessor, Dead Age 2 features random events on the map resulting in a variety of consequences, but this time those events are depicted fully in 3D. Survival RPGs are especially dangerous. 3 difficulty levels and permadeath may result at any time in losing an ally for good. If your main character falls victim to the apocalypse you are forced to begin a new playthrough, for which you can purchase upgrades and advantages unlocked in previous runs.
Gain enough standing with the factions and you may purchase things like upgraded faction equipment for newly-created characters, as well as unlock unique endings. This gives Dead Age 2 high replayability!",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/059/05931ea710001df1af79dbac33c9898d.jpg

Become an adventurer, hunt for treasures, explore unknown regions of the world and rescue the damsel in distress from the clutches of enemies, both earthly and not-so-earthly. Join James Lee Quatermain on his journey across the globe!The StoryThe year is 1938. James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn&#39;t one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain. And he knows how to squeeze money out of this famous name of his, while at the same time despising it. Despising those who believe his great-grandfather&#39;s tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike.
Accordingly, Quatermain isn&#39;t all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well.
But life has its ways of changing one&#39;s perspective. Quatermain soon finds himself part of a hunt across the globe - from the stormy deserts of Egypt to the icy depths of the Arctic, and all the way to the steaming jungles of Guatemala. In long forgotten temple structures the thrill of the chase awakens the true adventurer in Quatermain, as he and agent Goodwin strive to be one step ahead of the Nazis and the Russians, one step closer to obtaining the Heart of Atlantis. And deep in these temples, where age-old guardians awake from their eternal slumber, James soon learns that his great-grandfather&#39;s stories are not as crazy as he had always believed.

783,Deadlight,"Deadlight is a side-scrolling survival platformer with horror elements set in a post-apocalyptic 2.5D environment of Seattle. The game follows a former park ranger Randall Wayne, who tries to get to a safe zone located in the city, where he hopes his family will be waiting for him. Thus, he has to move across Seattle to reach his final destination. On his way, Randall, in control of players, should avoid both zombies and members of self-proclaimed local authority gang called New Law. The game is made in a cinematic manner to transfer the zombie apocalypse atmosphere correctly. The gameplay is divided into levels and consists of walking through platforms and solving puzzles. Players can use Randall’s ability to entrap zombies by luring them into environmental hazards, and other mechanics of running, creeping and climbing obstacles to bypass enemies. Although the protagonist has many hostiles, combat is unavoidable in only a few situations. However, the game features some melee weapons with extremely limited ammunition, so the fight is going to be tough.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/595/59556e1839b2e79b6f11f2c68a197663.jpg
784,Deadly Premonition,"Welcome to Greenvale, a remote rural town where mystery and murder go hand in hand.

785,The Deadly Tower of Monsters,"This is a top-down shooter with stick controls and hand-to-hand combat. The player has jet-pack for additional maneuverability. The plot of the game tells about three actors and the film of the same name. The story told in the visual style inspired by 50s American science fiction.
Space Explorer Dick Starspeed was wrecked on a mysterious planet. To find parts for a broken ship and his faithful assistant Robot, Dick goes on a dangerous journey across an unknown planet. The game presents a very diverse set of weapons: ray guns, crystal swords, and laser whips. All devices in the game can be improved with the help of spare parts found on the levels.
The game focuses on the movie style: in the settings, you can turn on the comments of the alleged director of the film. They are the link between the setting, the characters and the events that take place on the set. In addition to the story campaign, the game has a Survival mode, which is entirely independent. The player receives some gold and weapons and is surrounded by enemies in the arena. A full-fledged multiplayer is not here, but the game still can be played on one device in a cooperative mode.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c14/c1484e3baaa7a2c048d457c8a55980ef.jpg
786,Deadpool,"Deadpool wants to be the main protagonist of the game developed by High Moon Studios and in order to make them develop the game, he plants explosives in the studio. Deadpool even hires Nolan North to voice the protagonist. After Deadpool receives the scenario from the studio, he finds it boring and edits it with a pencil. The game continues according to the edited scenario after this point.
It is a combination of action, hack &amp; slash and a third-person shooter, where new hit combos are unlocked further into the game. In order to get new combos, the players have to kill a certain amount of enemies. The main feature of the game is the breaking of the fourth wall by Deadpool. The protagonist often talks to the player directly, shares his opinion on the player&#39;s performance and reveals parts of the plot. The combat gameplay revolves around combining both melee and ranged attacks. The player can change Deadpool&#39;s equipment on-the-go. Deadpool has the same regenerative powers as Wolverine and will get blown up into pieces on some plot occasions.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a2d/a2d80d32a35281c310a2b9d8cb02e5cf.jpg
787,Dear Esther,"Dear Esther is a game that questions the very concept of a &quot;game&quot; as an entertainment. It is more of an art project that was originally started as a mod on the Source engine (the one Half-Life 2 is based on). The player assumes the role of a nameless and faceless character, a man, who wanders around a cold island at the shores of Scotland. When you enter certain parts of the island, the main character reads aloud his letters from the past, revealing his tragic story. All other characters, including the protagonists’ wife Esther, are only mentioned by the narrator and do not appear in the game. There&#39;s very little actual gameplay, and your goal as a player is to explore the island and discover as many parts of the backstory as possible. The goal of the game is to follow the story, immerse yourself in the experience and pass it through your emotions.
Dear Esther is famous for its visual design and sound: there are gorgeous natural landscapes (the caves in particular), ambient sounds, and music. Melancholic mood and darkened landscapes befit the story that is all about loss and grief.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/bc6/bc6b163403504d0c041253749e233ed3.jpg

When rolling is not enough, you can climb a moving block to overcome an obstacle or perform any other maneuver. However, these tricks are not easy to master.

877,Eufloria,"In Eufloria, the player controls trees that grow in the outer space. It was inspired by a scientific theory put forward by the famous astronomer Freeman Dyson and was initially called Dyson in his honor. 
Premise
The player oversees the breeding of a plant, called Dyson tree, that can grow on comets and asteroids in the vacuum of space. The tree produces seedling that can be used to spread the species to many planetoids. According to the game&#39;s backstory, the trees try to make the planets habitable for an ancient extraterrestrial race called Growers who created the trees. They have to fight against a rival species, the greys, who are the evil, mutated version of Dyson trees.
Gameplay
The game is divided into levels. At the beginning of each level, the trees already inhabit an asteroid. The goal is to spread the trees to other asteroids. The seedlings are the units the player directly controls. They can be used to defend the trees from the enemy seedlings. They can explore the space to find new planetoids. It takes ten seedlings to start growing a tree on a planetoid. Larger asteroids take more time to grow a tree on. However, they eventually reward the player with better seedlings that move faster and have a wider range.
Style
Eufloria is very minimalist in its visuals. All of its elements are composed of simple geometric shapes. The game is set to equally minimalistic ambient music.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/354/35415d87481388c8632a299ce2a97bbf.jpeg

The time in the game is slightly different from the real time (1 minute in the set corresponds to five-ten seconds of real time). The driver can drive in total for 11 hours, after that he needs to go to the nearest Parking to make a nine-hour rest. If you do not, the driver gradually begins to struggle with sleep and yawn. The screen becomes dark, and the player, in turn, loses control of the truck, what can quickly lead to an accident.
In the game, there are temporary and permanent road signs that limit the speed mode. The maximum speed of all trucks in the game is technically limited to 90 km/h by default (but it can be disabled in the game settings).",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1f5/1f5ddf7199f2778ff83663b93b5cb330.jpg

The scientific progress has come, bringing new machines, factories, firearms, gaslight, steampunk aesthetics and a new way of life. And the Industrial Revolution is about to provoke the actual revolution.

Unlike the previous game, you are an aristocrat from the very beginning. It is up to you to take action and save your homeland this way or another, and it depends on you if your character is remembered as a wise and just leader or an evil tyrant.
The plot is non-linear, so the player&#39;s actions and decisions can influence not only other characters&#39; perception of him but also the world in general. Compared to Fable II, social interactions with NPC became simpler and more straightforward. It is usually enough to be nice to people to make them like you, or even fall in love with you.

894,Fade to Silence,"As the player you take the role of Ash, a natural but tormented leader. In that role you explore a post-apocalyptic, frozen wasteland to gather the resources necessary to establish a refuge for survival. With dwindling resources, simple tasks like upgrading equipment and collecting materials quickly require an expedition to scavenge the necessary items. In the search for survival materials, players must navigate a vast territory, in which they will encounter Eldritch monsters and an even greater foe: the unrelenting winter. While freezing temperatures constantly take their toll on the player Ash, the deadliest event is that of a blizzard. If caught by surprise, it takes every ounce of skill, determination and luck to survive.
In order to survive and overcome all challenges, the player needs to attract followers, bringing them into thei refuge. Each individual skillset and character traits grants access to higher tier resources and gear. Without such advances, the player character can scavenge only the barest necessities, crafting makeshift tools and weapons.
“You’re glad to have found wood; for once, you’ll have a roaring fire in the camp. As your sled wolves race home, you pay no attention to the strange lights in the forest. You’ve done enough for today.
The wind suddenly picks up - a blizzard is moving in fast. The voice in your head dares you to keep going,”Come on! You have plenty of time to make it back.” You doubt it, but stopping now means you need to build a shelter—out of that precious wood. The snow begins to fall; you have only a moment to decide. Should you risk it and keep going, or do you play it safe but lose your firewood?”
Fade to Silence introduces the many dynamics of a harsh winter climate to a complex, character-driven, group survival experience. The dynamic weather system adds to the immersion of survival in a cold, corrupted world. Survival depends on how well the players read weather patterns, and if they come to the right conclusion - look for shelter or press home. The dynamic snow displacement leaves a realistic path by both player character and NPC. This telltale sign will tell you regions where it is good to hunt and regions where monsters are roaming.
“You’re out hunting. The barren, snow-filled landscape is endless and unrelenting. A Ripper comes out of nowhere, and you fight it off, narrowly dodging its gigantic claws.
Then you see it: a distant fire. Another person? Impossible. But there’s a strange noise—a voice?  Wild hope sears your heart; you won’t be alone anymore. The voice in your head steps in, discouraging you from investigating. “Anyone living must have done terrible things to survive”, it says. You quiet the voice, defying it this time, and move in closer. Another person could help you rebuild, gather food, harvest deer. You see someone—yes! Someone else is out here. Then, you hear a scream. But you hesitate. How can you trust them? Another scream, desperate. There’s only one way to find out.”Features:Explore a vast winter landscape: The launch version lets you explore a river delta, a dense forest region and cultivated farmland of an 8km² area.

Felix The Reaper has sprung from a fascination with the sprawling, humorous and grotesque art history of Death. The history contains both The Dance of Death or Danse Macabre and Death And The Maiden as two central themes going through it. We sort of mashed those two together in Felix The Reaper.
For the character himself and the world around him the inspiration was more diverse: in that aspect, the game contains inspiration from the ancient tv-show The Twilight Zone, medieval painters like Bruegel and Bosch and the cartoon characters of Adventure Time and Hayao Miyazaki.
Another important inspiration for Felix The Reaper were the amazing artistic collaborators in the production. We&#39;ve worked with dancers, a long list of music artists and historian scholars.The DanceSeveral dancers have been around throughout the production, and eventually Gunilla Lind and Raphaël Ferdinand Eder-Kastling improvised the final moves, that ended up in the game.
Here&#39;s Gunilla doing a dance move for Felix:
And here&#39;s Raphael doing another:
The MusicOf course a game with a dancing protagonist needs great music - why else would he be dancing? We designed the game in a way that lets the music artists be themselves. We wanted them to add to the game through their personal artistic expression, rather than ask them to be what we want them to be. That makes for a varied and strange combination of music. But since the gameplay is a non-stressful puzzler, you actually have time to appreciate and enjoy the weirdness while playing.The Art HistoryThe idea for the game itself stems from art history. We actually started with The Danse Macabre and Death and The Maiden as a basis and then asked ourselves: how can we make a game about this? Eventually and through several different prototypes, we ended up here.
Parallel to the production a historical scholar has dived into the art history of Death across more than 10 centuries for a book manuscript he is working on, and every time he hit upon something interesting he told us, and we tried to put it in the game, if it fit. There&#39;s five different articles by this historian Søren Hein Rasmussen within the game, that you can unlock as you progress.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e2/9e267ccfe4e20b95815791ab391252b2.jpg

937,Forged of Blood,"Forged of Blood is pushing the boundaries of depth and mechanical complexity for the modern turn-based tactical RPG. Classless character building, strategic management, and small unit tactical gameplay combine to create a multi-layered experience that puts players in the middle of a civil war in a morally grey fantasy world.A game of hard decisions and harsher consequences, Forged of Blood will challenge players to make decisions across every layer of the game. On the battlefield, character builds, turn-order efficiency, and positioning will be key to victory. While off the battlefield, your choices on the world map will determine the fate of your kingdom and future of your people.Key Features:Tactical Fantasy: Take to the field with sword and shield or cast powerful spells in deep turn-based tactical combat against monsters and men.Classless Warfare: With 9 unique weapons and a vast magic system, Forged of Blood lets you build your characters any way you want – without being constrained by the typical tank/DPS/healer roles.Science in Magic: Explore the freedom and mysteries of one of the most complex and unique magic systems ever attempted in video games.Kingdom at War: Command up to three parties of heroic characters on the strategic layer in your fight to reclaim the empire you lost.Meaningful Choice: Your choices matter.

Forged of Blood will introduce a new Tri-axis Personality Plot (TAPP) system in lieu of the traditional Good vs. Evil scale common in most RPG settings.Tactical fantasy, unbound.Building your own character has rarely been so liberating with 9 weapon types – each with its own ability trees - along with 6 general ability trees. Going into battle, players will be able to take customized parties of up to five characters, each with two weapon sets and abilities to respond to any tactical situation.Spellcrafting, as it should be.Few systems will match the freedom of our Magurite Spellcrafting mechanics. Forged of Blood puts players in direct control of the powerful magical forces they can wield in battle, allowing the creation of spells from 6 different “Primordials” each with 8 Effect Classes, that can be individually modified with 12 Effect Modifiers. The spell is then shaped and tuned through 12 unique Global Modifiers. This is spellcrafting the way it should be.Philosophy in War.Focusing on player choice, Forged of Blood accentuates the morally grey world of Attiras with a personality trait system that follows the player’s actions on a Tri-Axis Personality Index. With no light or dark, good or bad, right or wrong – actions are judged by three philosophies: Altruism, Rationalism, and Hedonism.Small Unit Tactics on a World Scale.Your forces are few, but the world is large. Forged of Blood is a game that will be won on and off the field of battle as players manage 3 parties across the great continent of Attiras. Striking the balance between outright conquest, appeasing conquered territories, and managing your own character's growth will prove that while tactics may win the battle, strategy will win the war.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c3/7c3b4ec1f642783f50d2f8949dbe4e0d.jpg

Welcome to Warsaw City in the XXII century, where &quot;real&quot; is a relative term and &quot;life&quot; and &quot;death&quot; have many meanings. Virtual worlds give rise to real problems: lust, sloth, envy, and pride. That’s why the residents of these virtual game-worlds need specialists – Gamedecs who discover and exploit cheats hidden in the realities of their clients. Wild West or the jungle of a prehistoric entertainment park, throughout these and many other worlds, they are facing human nature, which, despite many changes, has remained the same...
Gamedec is a pure RPG experience equipped with mechanics such as a codex, aspects, and deduction. Fight conversational duels, discover or build schemes of intrigue, save lives, and discover extraordinary relationships between the virtual worlds and their inhabitants. The game emulates the nature of a tabletop RPG by focusing on choice-dependent character building.
Gamedec, like classic tabletop RPGs, gives you the freedom to approach situations from multiple angles rather than forcing a single solution. Remember: the choice is yours.

973,Gold Rush: The Game,"Those of you who have never dreamt about finding a gold nugget, please raise your hand. Ok, now, gather around, because I’m about to tell you something. The rest of you can just enjoy this experience, because there is nothing I can tell you to make you even more interested. It’s just a “dream come true” for all of us, right?
Gold Rush allows you to discover the tough experience of gold mining. You start with just an excavator, but with passing seasons, you become the wealthiest man in Alaska.
We created a big, detailed world with four unique gold mining claims. On each, you will find a fully deformable terrain. Each fragment of our world has its own background story you can discover in spare time.
Our main goal was to create a high-fidelity simulation. You will spend a lot of time in the excavator, as it is the main gold mining tool, so with that in mind, we spend the majority of our time giving you the best possible experience.
There is no campaign in our game. Instead, we decided, after a long tutorial, you will go into Sandbox mode, where you will not be constrained by anything.
Remember, nobody can work all day, all night. Even if you’d like to, the hard work of gold miners is often hampered by the force of nature. Difficult weather conditions can easily spoil the machines and stop the extraction for a long time, not to mention the winter, when you can’t dig at all.

979,Greed Corp,"Greed Corp is a strategy game developed by W!Games.
Plot
There is not much story present in the game, however, it tells the players about four opposing factions. These factions are eager to take over the world and represent multiple nations joined up into one.
Factions
The game&#39;s factions are the same in gameplay, yet every one of them features a distinct visual style. 
The Freemen are much like the ancient tribal societies and respect the environment they live in. All their units are built up using wood and other natural materials. Their territories look like farms with many windmills.
The Pirates make a living by robbing others. They also resort to trading with other factions. The units of this faction appear to be made out of scrap metal. Their territories look like deserts with occasional buildings.
The Cartel resembles a group of corporations which profit from mining natural resources. They heavily use materials to build their units and their territories look to be urbanistic.
The Empire is the only sustained government in the game. It is highly industrialized and militarized. Their units and territories feature a lot of steel.
Gameplay
Greed Corp is a turn-based game that takes place on a field of collapsing tiles. Credits are gained by harvesting resources on the tiles. If the players harvest too fast, the tile begins to collapse. The players have to completely annihilate their opponent to win a game using troops, harvesters, and transporters.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/793/7933fec6385f898777b7ad44a2b84efd.jpg
980,Greedfall,"GreedFall is the latest RPG from Spiders, currently in development for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. Set in a 17th century setting embedded in magic, Greedfall has a unique visual identity inspired by European Baroque art, depicting grandiose sceneries in muted warm colors and dark undertones.
Explore a fresh new world as – along with many other settlers, mercenaries and treasure hunters - you set foot on a remote island seeping with magic, rumored to be filled with riches and lost secrets. A grand journey filled with mystery follows, as you find yourself in the middle of ever-increasing tensions between the invading settlers and the locals, who are protected by manifestations of the island’s earthly magic in the form of supernatural beings.
With a strong focus on its core RPG identity, GreedFall follows Spider&#39;s experience in building intricate worlds filled with mysteries to discover, weaving deep character interactions, and offering players freedom to achieve quests and objectives in many different ways – through combat, as well as diplomacy, deception or stealth. The island of GreedFall is a living, ever-evolving world. Your actions, from seemingly trivial choices to the most important political decisions, will influence and alter its course, as well as the relationship between the different factions established on the island.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c68/c6842e7b1e4a8c5fdff79504b7284e49.jpg
981,Grey Goo,"Grey Goo is a real-time strategy game developed by Petroglyph Games in collaboration with Weta Workshop.
Plot
On a distant habitable planet called Ecosystem Nine, three factions confront each other. Humans, Betas, and the Grey Goo nanobots. The humans arrive on the planet to investigate an unusual signal, as they thought to be to only intelligent beings in the planet system. Betas established a colony after escaping from their own planet. And the Goo used to be an old human-made surveillance system, which reprogrammed itself and tries to return to its creators while consuming everything on its way.
Gameplay
The players are free to choose any faction to play as both in singleplayer campaign and multiplayer PvP mode. Each faction has its own set of units, buildings and drastically differs in gameplay from every other one. For example, Betas rely on speed and mobility to outmaneuver their enemies, while humans can use teleportation devices to deploy their forces to the battlefield quickly and reconstruct their own base in a matter of seconds. 
The game&#39;s developers put a heavy emphasis on the preference of macro decisions instead of micromanagement. This being said, the player&#39;s strategy serves as a deciding factor in winning the game, not the speed with which they buy their units and build structures.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e37/e37cfceae9b2f79c29a1e9a8155c2d63.jpg

The race will be held in such places as Paris, Hong Kong, Chicago, Dubai, etc. All the tracks, drivers, teams, cars and sponsors in the game are real.
Compared to GRID (the first part of the series), there are more modes. There were races on the so-called &quot;Checkpoint&quot;,  endurance race and other several options. And the significant thing now that there is no driving on the rails, sudden acceleration of rivals and unpunished wiping of bumpers (also, damage to the machine is not displayed on the screen, it is necessary to focus on its behaviour and the replica of racing engineer).
The main feature of GRID is time rewinding. The number of rewinds is limited, but with this, you can save yourself from a fatal outcome.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/27b/27b02ffaab6b250cc31bf43baca1fc34.jpg

The game tells us a story of several humans that try to adapt and survive the harsh times.
Like in most Action RPGs, the main focus of the game is put on battling the enemies and gathering loot - armor, potions, weapons, and gold. Grim Dawn features a crafting system that is similar to the one in a popular mod DoTA. The developers put a strong emphasis on the enhanced physics in the game, environmental kills, enemies dismemberment and a totally new mission system. 
The players are free to choose one of eight classes present in the game. Several factions are also featured. As the plot progresses, the player will have to choose which factions to join. Joining one faction will make the opposing one hostile to the protagonist.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/920/92039cd19460532b76f6244b2bb3e4ac.jpg

A living world where the environment, characters, and animations are hand-drawn and carefully put together by our artists, sets the atmosphere of your journey.
A branching narrative, that makes the game&#39;s progress depend strongly on your choices;
Gameplay
Grimshade is a fabulous adventure during which you explore a vast and rich world and fight formidable enemies. The gameplay is divided into two distinct phases - adventure and combat.
Adventure
Adventure mode is your exciting journey through Ree&#39;Fah world. As well as progressing the story at your own pace, you will discover different races, acquire better equipment and meet new characters.
You are free to move within the area and choose your destinations: it&#39;s up to you to decide whether to go to the nearest city or to look around in the current location, to complete some quests (and which ones) or to test your strength in a difficult dungeon. After completing all the plot-related quests, you leave the area to the next and never come back.
Unique residents with rich history inhabit each area you visit. Embrace the spirit of the local culture and spend your time interacting with the natives — you are sure to find something to help you on your main quest or discover a whole new adventure to go on. Of course, when the stakes are this high, conflict is unavoidable, so prepare for battle by choosing the right tools for the job - find, trade for, or craft a wide range of equipment to improve your characters and make them versatile and adaptable.
Combat system
We spent a lot of time and effort developing our unique approach to battles and making them as interesting and exciting as possible. Any unexpected turn of events can get you into a fight. The world is also inhabited by a lot of hostile creatures that you will have to defeat in the course of events.
At the start, you will have to pick a squad from your character&#39;s team including up to 4 members. The battle takes place on a stage consisting of two opposite fields, where characters and enemies are located on their respective sides. Characters move and act in a specific order according to their initiative.
We developed a unique scenario for each battle. Each new enemy has their own features diversifying the fights and making you experiment and seek new approaches to succeed in the combat encounters. Naturally, each new battle requires more skill than the previous one.
We have not forgotten about the tactical battles lovers. Some locations in Grimshade include special missions - hostile dungeons of a higher level of complexity. Here, every encounter with the boss turns into a mortal game of wits. Think over your strategy and prepare a squad that will be able to go through the dungeon in one go. In the end, you&#39;ll get a well-deserved reward!
Heroes
Although Grimshade is a single-player game, you won&#39;t be traveling alone. Advancing through the story, you&#39;ll get acquainted with seven heroes. Their personalities, focus, and backgrounds are pre-set, but you can control their skills and develop the relationship between the party members.
We hope to add another hero soon after reaching one of the goals, and the script of the game suggests twelve of them.
Story
After the Great Flood, being torn apart by the heirs of Amon Darvish the Great and long-running civil war, the Kingdom of Easeon split into three states. Ree&#39;Fah witnessed the dark age for both livs and eleores. Nevertheless, after years of wandering, each group of people still managed to find a haven from the dreadful lands of the Hardfore continent, inhabited by monsters. Amazing technologies, the legacy of ancestors, secret knowledge of the world&#39;s nature, great and splendid objectives of the future were lost forever during battles for survival and hard work on settling the new society on the ruins of ancient cities, hostile wastelands, and dangerous mountain highlands.
Eighty years have passed. When old wounds almost healed and people just embarked on the road to prosperity, new enemy forces gained the power to enter the scene, threatening the fragile stability of every living creature&#39;s life in the world.
Art
During one and a half years of development, the visual component of Grimshade has changed a lot. From a stylized watercolor environment with 2D characters, we moved on to adding 3D models of characters to the 2D world, creating our own shader, and a detailed environment.
Our artists drew the whole game by hand and carefully put it together, that&#39;s why the world of Ree&#39;Fah is full of life even in the most secluded corners. Hope you can feel this!",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2c/e2cdf0b0ebb32ab0b1e3892ec579873a.jpg

You play cards against the Dealer, who is both your DM, opponent, and narrator of your adventures. Each card represents an item, a character, or an encounter. You navigate your character through the story that unfurls as you reveal the cards and make your choices. The goal is to collect a powerful deck of cards that give your character better weapons, armor, and other equipment. You can unlock more cards after you defeat bosses and complete quests. The Dealer’s goal is to hamper your progress, as he plays his cards to put new obstacles in your way.
Most of the time the game will only show you the cards and the Dealer who sits across the table from you. You will learn the events from listening to him and reading the text on cards. Battles, however, are actually fought in real time by animated characters on visualized 3D arenas. This is very unusual for board game simulators and brings some variety into the gameplay.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9c/b9cb8c4e69907a68e33a4ebb2580f82a.jpg

1000,Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice,"A dark fantasy game that takes inspiration from Scandinavian and Celtic folklore, Hellblade is set in a gritty barbarian world full of weird wooden structures and creepily masked enemies. 
The player assumes the role of Senua, a traumatized female warrior from the Pict tribe. She suffers from a growing psychosis after her lover Dillion was brutally murdered by Vikings. Carrying his severed head, Senua sets out to Helheim, the underworld of the dead, to bring her lover&#39;s soul back. Her grim and bloody journey mirrors her descent into madness. It becomes increasingly difficult for her (and, thus, the player) to tell fact from fantasy, as she hears voices in her head and sees hallucinations. 
When not fighting her enemies, Senua has to solve puzzles to move forward. This is where her distorted perception actually comes out handy, enabling her to &quot;focus&quot; and see what regular people can not. The ghostly voices, recorded using the binaural method to create an eery effect, also help to guide Senua or to warn her about dangers. All of Senua movements, expressions and reactions were recorded through motion capture to make them more realistic and emotional.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/63f/63f0e68688cad279ed38cde931dbfcdb.jpg

In punishment, the scientist is sent to another world - the world of impossible flowers. Impossible colors are those colors that are invisible to the human eye, they are outside the visible spectrum.
The player plays for a little boy named Hue, who one morning wakes up and starts looking for eight visible сolors to save the scientist from the world of invisible colors.
Game mechanics based on color
In the game, objects can be seen, but with them you can do something only if the color of these objects is different from the color of the game&#39;s background. For example, you start with a black background, and you can see a black door on a black background - you can see its outline. But you can open it only if you change its color to some other one. or if you change the background color. And you can change the background color only when you find, &quot;open&quot; some color. For example, the first color to open in the game is Aqua. After you open this color, you can make this color the background color of the game. And then the door will be black and you will be able to open it. This technique is used in many games - but usually it is implemented only for one color, for example, white on black or vice versa. In Hue, the player deals with eight colors - after the opening of each next color, the game is correspondingly more complicated.
There are many objects in the game that you need to interact with in order to go further. And each object has to be made real by using the color mechanics described above. And also find a way to properly interact with the object itself. There are many puzzles in the game, and often they seem to be unresolved, but after the decision is finally found, the player is usually surprised how he could not see this decision from the very beginning.
The Mysteries of the Final
In addition to the fascinating mechanics, the game also has a story - a story about a woman researcher who discovered color for a one-color world. This story develops throughout the game, its fragments open gradually and in the end everything will turn into one picture.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d9/2d9f74addd8f5b5f83459c2cb700aaf4.jpg

Her quest to slay Heskel leaves a trail of carnage throughout huge, multi-path levels filled with gigantic explosions, more secret areas than we can count, and inhuman foes behind every corner. There’s no regenerating health here; stop taking cover and start running and gunning.

Plot
The events depicted in the game force the player to explore the world of Kholatsyakhl — Ural mountain, leaving no stone unturned to find the truth about the death of nine students on the Dyatlov Pass. The point of the game is to find all of the notes and progress through the plot, but collecting all the items is not necessary — it is nonetheless recommended to assemble them all to recollect the 1959 events. 
Gameplay
The game is mostly about exploring and uncovering the mystery behind the death of the hike participators. There are some jump-scares involved. The gameplay centers around walking and hiding from The Shadows of the dead students— the only hostile characters in the game. With the absence of jumping ability, the protagonist has quite a few exploring tricks at their disposal.

Some level areas also need the activation of interactive objects (e.g. switches) to move forward. During missions Mondo fights with challenging enemies, using a katana and cybernetic weapons. If you use your left hand, camera&#39;s angle changes view to the perspective over the shoulder.
There are three types of missions in the game: story missions (advance the narrative forward), submissions (they are set at the main missions where Mondo performs various tasks ranging from combat missions to quests), and&quot; Scarlet &quot; missions where the female Starlet support character issues combat missions.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3b/e3b7dfc3823777208c178a1f66e876b5.jpg

In the turn-based campaign the changing seasons have effect on the gameplay and the graphics of the Campaign Map. Create your own legend! The saga of King Arthur is an epic tale about the conquest of Britannia through a story-based campaign. The Campaign is divided into chapters, like a chronicle, each with a unique tone and theme. The chapters all have objectives, long- and short-term goals that also fit together to draw a grandiose picture of an unfolding storyline. There are many possible events and outcomes that all influence the legend itself and determine the ending of the storyline. Morality Chart: Every decision in the game will influence the position of King Arthur on the Morality Chart. King Arthur might become a Christian ruler or the Follower of the Old Faith; a rightful or a ruthless monarch. These choices unlock special contents, allies, heroes, units and developments. RPG elements: Heroes lead the armies and learn skills, spells and abilities from an ability tree for experience points. Heroes can also use magic items or become liege lords, entrusted with the leadership of a province, which is the best way to have them indebted. Arranging their marriages with the nice damsels of Arthur’s court also raises their loyalty. Adventures: adventuring is the essence of King Arthur’s world. Quests pop up on the Campaign Map regularly. In technical terms it is a short story where the chosen knight has to make important decisions. Some adventures end in battles on special battlemaps.

1079,Knights And Bikes,"KNIGHTS AND BIKES is a hand-painted action-adventure set on a fictional British island in the late 1980s, inspired by coming-of-age movies like The Goonies and classic games like Earthbound and Secret of Mana.
The story features two new friends: Nessa &amp; Demelza. They&#39;re tough and imaginative girls exploring the island of Penfurzy in search of mysteries and treasure. Cycling around on their bikes, exploring the natural beauty of their surroundings, they experience their first taste of a more grown-up freedom. But this new-found independence also leads them into danger, both modern and ancient.
With a mixture of ingenuity and imagination, they deal with enemies and a challenging environment using frisbees, water-balloons, a cranked-up stereo, a pet goose, and more. The trinkets they collect from their adventures allow them to upgrade their bikes and widen their treasure-hunt.
As Nessa and Demelza try to figure-out the puzzling adult world around them, it&#39;s their friendship and imagination that guides them on their quest: to find the legendary treasure! (as well as saving some of those stupid adults that just keep disappearing).

1085,Lara Croft GO,"Lara Croft GO is a turn-based isometric puzzle game drawn in material design style. This is the fourth spin-off of the enormous Tomb Raider series.
Gameplay
The game ties turn mechanics and adventure game — even though it sounds contradictory, this merger works. So, the game features usual Tomb Raider gameplay which is: raiding tombs, exploring crypts and fighting multiple enemies. 
During forty levels divided into five chapters the player must take turns — he can go into one of four directions — left, right, up and down. The time given for turns is unlimited, so it is the move-when-ready type of title.
Going through levels namely means learning foes&#39; moving patterns and memorizing the locations of all traps within the level. Lara can climb cliffs and hang down from the ledges to avoid being detected by opponents. The new types of traps and things to avoid are evolving with every next level. 
GO also features “look-for-objects” genre as the player is allowed to collect vases throughout the levels
Plot
The narrative in the title transfers itself via visuals, not dialogues, so it is hard to compose any meaningful story with it. The absence of subsequent storytelling may be explained with the hints mechanics — it is utterly troublesome to translate a story arc if the help may be requested at any time and level would be over in no time.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/664/6641c8e3872da0b3e6a853ad7b6a37b0.jpg

1089,The Last Guardian,"The Last Guardian is a brainchild of Fumito Ueda, who also created Shadow of the Colossus. The game spent almost a decade in development before it was complete. The Last Guardian is defined by its spectacular mountain landscapes, eerie music, and a heartwarming mood.
The main protagonist is a nameless boy, who is kept as a prisoner in cyclopean castle ruins and has to escape. While in captivity, the boy’s first task is to befriends his cellmate, a fantasy creature named Trico, who is a gigantic half-bird, half-cat hybrid that slightly reminds a hippogriff. Trico is the second main character and the mascot of The Last Guardian; the creature’s animation is incredibly detailed, and its behavior is modeled after real animals. The two form an unlikely symbiosis. The boy needs the creature’s strength and ability to fly to overcome obstacles and fend off guards who try to bring the characters back to their cells. Trico, in turn, needs the boy’s wits and agility to sneak, solve puzzles, feed the creature and heal its wounds. The player only controls the boy, while Trico needs to be manipulated into performing certain actions. Over time, the characters develop a strong emotional bond that adds to the game’s impact on the player.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/276/2769b1982cd132a60c69dc5d574445fa.jpg

1098,LEGO The Hobbit,"LEGO The Hobbit is another installment in the LEGO series of games adapted from popular movie franchises. It is based on the first two films in Peter Jackson&#39;s The Hobbit film trilogy, that was, in turn, adapted from John R.R. Tolkien&#39;s book of the same name. Like with all LEGO games, its visual style imitates a world that is entirely made of LEGO constructions and inhabited by mini-figures.
Plot
The game follows the plot of the movies rather than the original book. LEGO The Hobbit recreates The Hobbit story using voice samples from the movies, while also parodying it with the addition of the tongue-in-cheek humor. The plot takes place in the high fantasy world of Middle-Earth. Bilbo Baggins, the main protagonist, is a hobbit. He lived a peaceful life until one day a company of thirteen dwarves and the wizard named Gandalf called him to join them on an adventure. Bilbo and his new friends left out on a quest to reconquer the dwarves&#39; home, the Lonely Mountain, and its treasures from the wicked dragon Smaug. 
Gameplay
The player controls the Thorin&#39;s party, switching between characters when needed. Each character has his unique abilities, such as climbing or shooting arrows. The game is divided into a series of short, linear levels that correspond to certain scenes in the movies. On the way, the player has to smash objects made of LEGO and sometimes use them to assemble new objects. The game also has a cooperative multiplayer for two.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/e4f/e4fb3fd188f61fabec48dca22e6ef28a.jpg

1103,Lichdom: Battlemage,"In the game, you can follow two storylines, depending on whether you choose a male or female character.
Both versions of the character have their own reasons to hate the leader of evil forces, Shax. If a female character is selected, his sister is abducted by Shax as a result of a dispute over the jewelry that the player was selling. In the case of a man&#39;s game, the player refuses to sell the sword to Shax, resulting in Shax killing the character&#39;s wife.
Everything else in the game is the same for both female and male characters.
The character awakens to a new life by the great magician Roth. The great magician reveals to the character that the character was chosen to become the new Dragon - there have already been more than a dozen other Dragons before. The Dragon is given combat magic, the Dragon&#39;s task is to protect this world and rid it of lies, corruption and evil spirits.
Gameplay
The main character, male or female, accepts from the great magician Roth the name Dragon and the mission of improving the world.

The hero is armed with magic - and it does not require replenishment of any resource, it always is, always works.
The enemies of the Dragon are diverse and contain a randomized loot, dropping out of them when defeated. The value of loot based on the rarity level of the character has been achieved through reaching checkpoints.
The magic of the hero, the power of his spells can be greatly increased if the hero performs specific tasks.
The main character helps another character, male or female. This character acts as a scout whose name is Gryphon.

You can switch between the Sigils you use at a Reliquary.
The level of each Sigil can be increased by achieving certain goals. The characteristics of magical spells can be improved and customized, by conscious manipulation and using the loot dropping out of enemies.
Spells act not only as weapons of attack, but also as shields.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bd/9bdd4a4a2953666d27e88ff72edfd845.jpg

1139,Magicka,"Magicka is a fun franchise. Based on Scandinavian mythology, we follow a story of four mages that have formed an order to protect Midgard from a warlock. Yet this warlock is just a pawn in the greater game of a demon Assatur, who wants to destroy wants to destroy the homeland of the mages. The game gives few nods towards some other known franchises as Warhammer, Warcraft or even Star Wars.
Gaming process is very complicated. Having no character class as it is, every mage can create his unique combinations from eight different types of magic - water, life, shield, cold, lightning, arcane, earth and fire. Some of them are not compatible such as fire and cold because of their opposing nature, but the game deeply explores the way to create a unique gameplay-style based on your preference. Around the world, you can find magickas - scrolls that contain new spells and magic. Supporting up to four players at the same time it is a very fun game despite having loads of technical issues, like bugs and other problems.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c7a/c7a71a0531a9518236d99d0d60abe447.jpg
1140,Magicka 2,"Magicka 2 is an action-adventure game developed by Arrowhead Game Studios. The game serves as a direct continuation of the first Magicka.
Once upon a time, four mages saved Midgard from complete destruction. However, the war between magic schools broke out after that. Most of the wizards passed away. Humanity entered a Golden Age without the mages destroying the human&#39;s way of life. During this period a prophecy of a child that would make Midgard a better place emerges. The prophecy also told that the evil forces will oppose the child. Mages set out on a quest to save the child.
The game could be played alone or in a cooperative mode with up to four players. Unlike most role-playing games, Magicka 2 does not feature any class system. Every character is armed with a staff and a melee weapon.
Magicka 2 features a high degree of satire and a lot of references to other games. For example, one of the weapons the player can use is the Excalibur or the M60 machine gun crafted by a local blacksmith from a string and a shotgun. The main feature of the game is the dynamic spellcasting system that allows combining 8 elementals in order for the player to choose their own playstyle.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/516/516c6bfe36ddb498d860f68927448a75.jpg

Those who hold even the smallest morsel of power will make every effort to ensure their songs live on. Enter the Mascherines - masks that grant their wielders the power to channel the elements and cast destructive magic.
The Mascherines have perpetuated a culture of inequality between the power-hungry guildsmen known as the Masquerada and the impoverished lower classes, the Contadani. A prolonged civil war, ignited by Contadani rebels who steal Mascherines from the Masquerada, has only drawn scars of mistrust across the Citte since.
One of Ombre’s finest sleuths, Cicero Gavar, was exiled for a crime against the state five years ago, but he is now summoned back to Ombre to solve the mysterious kidnapping of the diplomat Razitof Azrus. As other members of the Masquerada join his investigation, all having their doubts about one another within this culture of deception, their faith will be pushed to the limit as a deeper conspiracy lurks in the shadows of Ombre.

1154,MASSIVE CHALICE,"Massive Chalice is a fantasy turn-based tactical game in the vein of XCOM. 
Plot
The player assumes the role of an immortal leader in a fantasy kingdom. A dark power called Cadence repeatedly attacks the kingdom, corrupting everything it touches. There&#39;s a magic item called Massive Chalice that can purge the world of Cadence. However, the Chalice takes 300 years to recharge. The player&#39;s task is to hold on until the artifact reaches its full power. The Chalice has two souls that serve as the player&#39;s advisers.
Gameplay
The player rules the kingdom using the world map in the Strategy mode and directly controls the units in the Tactical mode. The king himself does not appear as a unit. Instead, the player controls a group of champions with various skills and attributes. Some of the Cadence monsters that oppose the heroes have unusual attacks such as stealing the hero&#39;s XP points or aging the character.
Since the player is immortal, the time is very compressed. The heroes eventually die of old age, which makes them disposable. The player has to breed new heroes and build dynasties by arranging marriages. There are three main classes of heroes: Caberjacks (heavy warriors), Hunters (ranged archers), and Alchemists (similar to wizards). Newborn heroes inherit their parents&#39; class, but if their parents are of different classes, they can learn certain skills from both. The heroes can also inherit artifacts that become stronger after being used by generations of ancestors.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00f/00fab9a3c5d62f286f3a269bbd2c7650.jpg

Next Gen Mobility - By the 31st century, tanks have evolved to take on humanoid shape, their treads replaced with nimble legs. Like modern tanks, 'Mechs move their upper torso and weapons independently of their legs offering unparalleled mobility while exchanging fire. Depending on their size, BattleMechs travel at vastly different speeds and offer different systems like jump jets to aid in their locomotion.Make Every Shot Count - Pilots must balance mobility and damage output against the amount of heat generated from their weapons fire and 'Mech operation, lest they risk the temporary loss of power that comes when a 'Mech overheats. Firing all weapons simultaneously (known as an Alpha Strike) can be the quickest way to devastate an opponent, but may leave a 'Mech helpless against its enemies if the heat sinks can't handle the stress.Fight Smart - 'Mechs possess both external armor and strong internal structural elements to help minimize the chance of a 'quick kill'. As a result, pilots must treat each encounter with the utmost attention and awareness, prioritizing weaker or more critical components before delivering the killing blow. Communication among teammates and the effective use of targeting systems can help to identify vulnerable 'Mechs and components.Teamwork is the Difference - Targeting a 'Mech will automatically allow your teammates to achieve their own lock, allowing them to ascertain vital location data, armor status, and loadout details for the targeted enemy. Information Warfare can be a vital component for victory, providing attack-focused allies with the necessary information to tear their opponents to pieces.Information Warfare - While fast-moving scouts feed target and tactical information back to the main battle group and the team commander, long-range Support and heavy-hitting Brawler and Assault ‘Mechs will use this information to position themselves for the perfect strike. Pilots can also shield themselves and allies from enemy sensors and weapons fire using various counter measures. It is up to each pilot to customize their BattleMech loadout to fulfill their desired role. Find the perfect 'Mech - Hundreds of unique 'Mechs are available, offering a wide range of strengths and weaknesses. Smaller 'Mechs should never stop moving, and can rely on their sheer speed to overwhelm heavier opponents. Larger 'Mechs move slow and deliberate but can stand toe-to-toe with other large opponents. Acquire and test different 'Mechs to find those that best suit your play style.Choose Your Allegiance - Work for the powerful empires of the galaxy to earn their loyalty and spread their influence across the stars. Band together with other pilots using the Looking For Group feature, or use the Faction Chat feature to coordinate offensive and defensive strategies to capture or defend worlds and shift the balance of power.Get Rewarded - Pilots earn ComStar Bills (C-Bills) from playing matches and completing faction contracts, which can be used to purchase new 'Mechs and equipment.Certain items can only be purchased using premium 'Mech Credits (MC). MC can either be purchased directly via real world money or acquired in smaller increments in-game by earning reputation with a Faction in Faction Play, or as rewards from participating in special Events.'Mech Experience (XP) gained during combat is applied to the 'Mech used during that match, and can be used to unlock improvements to various BattleMech systems.MechWarrior Online™ also includes a host of achievements to unlock that will challenge even the most skilled players.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4d/f4dfbaaa2c33178e9af184a6c89172f8.jpg

1159,Mega Man 11,"Mega Man 11 is the eleventh game in the main series of Mega Man franchise. It is designed n the vein of classic 16-bit 2D platformers.
Plot
Long ago, Dr. Wily, a would-be mad scientist, created a device called the Double Gear System that could increase the powers of robots by pushing them to the limit. The device was banned for being too dangerous for robots. This time, however, Dr. Wily decided to complete his creation and test it on the eight robots he stole from his former colleague, the wise Dr. Light. Using Double Gear, Dr. Wily creates Robot Masters of the stolen robots to help him to conquer the whole world. Mega Man, a good robot and the protagonist of the series, cannot defeat the stronger and faster Robot Masters. To help him win, Dr. Light temporarily installs him a variation of the Double Gear System.
Gameplay
The player controls Mega Man in a 2D environment, as he runs through the levels and defeats evil robots. There are eight unique Robot Masters that serve as the game&#39;s bosses.
The Double Gear System not only sets up the game&#39;s plot but also works as a game mechanic. Using it, Mega Man can access two additional skills. The first is “Speed Gear” that allows him to slow the time down as if he moves and reacts incredibly fast. The other is “Power Gear” that allows Mega Man to make attacks that deal more damage. In accordance with the game&#39;s plot, however, the use of the Double Gear System is not safe and can overheat Mega Man.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f75/f751a9a43abb507bf95f9b96cc79feac.jpg

1161,Memoria,"Also known as The Dark Eye: Memoria, it&#39;s a point-and-click adventure game from a German developer and publisher of Daedalic Entertainment. The game is part of the series, based on the game The Dark Eye in 1984 and a direct continuation of the plot of Chains of Satinav.
The history of Memoria begins immediately after the end of the events of the previous game and tells the story of Geron&#39;s quest to find a way to help his fairy Nuri. The plot develops linearly. The developers use story-in-story method to tell two parallel telling two stories of two heroes. The camera in the game is in such a position that the player feels like an observer of the game world. To direct characters to a certain point on a screen it is necessary to click there. Clicking is also helping with interacting with objects, the characters comment on their possible use of items, and this is somewhat simplifying the task of the player.
The game tries to connect the classic point-and-click gameplay with the mysterious setting and features of The Dark Eye RPG universe.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc5/bc50266c05f2cc473bf98c4033c2f285.jpg

As Snake now is the Big Boss, Ground Zeroes follows Peace Walker entry some little time after it. Considering that Paz Ortega Andrade has died, MSF starts to work in different ways when suddenly there is information that Paz is being detained by Camp Omega on Cuba. The situation becomes even worse when Ricardo &quot;Chico&quot; Libre is sent for rescue and being captured as well. Snake is now headed to Cuba to save them or confirm their deaths. 
Still being a stealth action game, spotting system has been changed in Ground Zeroes, as now there is now meters, and the player must navigate through his eyes and ears to understand if he&#39;s been spotted. Reflex Mode is also added to the game. When the player is spotted, there is a little gap of time in slow-motion to kill the enemy before he alarms everyone around him. As well now the iDroid system in the game can be connected to your phones in order to have a look at an in-game map.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/7ac/7aca7ccf0e70cd0974cb899ab9e5158e.jpg

MGS5: Phantom Pain has an advanced AI system that will allow enemy soldiers constantly call for reinforcements if they see that something is wrong, forcing players to take down communications and fight or retreat and try again. 
Players will manage the base by gathering and managing staff, weaponry, and resources, in order to upgrade their personal arsenal and companions.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/490/49016e06ae2103881ff6373248843069.jpg

1166,Metro Exodus,"Metro Exodus is the third installment in the Metro series. It is based on the series of post-apocalyptic novels by Russian writer Dmitry Glukhovsky. The game is the sequel to Metro: Last Light and is set two years after its ending.
Plot
Exodus takes place in the year 2036 in post-apocalyptic Russia. According to the Metro universe backstory, in 2013 the planet was devastated by a total nuclear war. The atomic bombing left many parts of the Earth&#39;s surface uninhabitable due to high radiation rates, dangerous mutated monsters, and anomalies abound. The last remnants of humanity survive by hiding in the subway tunnels (hence the name of the series). The main protagonist is Artyom, a former dweller of Moscow Metro. Together with his wife Anna, he escaped the capital to search for survivors in the Russian Far East (thus making the “Redemption” ending of the Last Light the series&#39; canon). 
Gameplay
The player controls Artyom from the first person view. Exodus introduces the sandbox open-world, although the game combines it with the traditional linear levels. Unlike in previous games, Exodus is set mostly outside the subway system. Thus, the game also introduces the weather, the day and night cycle and the change of seasons. The player explores the Russian wilderness during and after the nuclear winter and rides a steam locomotive named Aurora through Siberia.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/152/152e788b7504aa2753c86dae912fb34c.jpg
1167,Metro: Last Light,"Metro: Last night is a first-person shooter, the continuation of the original game Metro 2033. 
In it, Artyom - the main character of the game will try to protect the subway from a new threat again. The developers took the bad ending of the first part as a continuation when Artyom destroyed the entire Moscow population of the Dark Ones. However, during the bombing, one of the representatives of the suddenly extinct species hid somewhere under a bush and safely survived the misfortune. The order learned about &quot;The lucky one&quot;, and Artyom receives a task to find and destroy the sole survivor.
You will get access to entirely new locations in the Moscow&#39;s metro, on the surface of the destroyed Moscow and walk through the newly added stations and familiarise themselves with the lives of people who are trying to live after the Apocalypse. At your disposal will also be the latest Arsenal of weapons, because you will have to shoot a lot to save your life. During the game, your actions can lead to one of the two endings, one of which, as in the case of Metro 2033, is false.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/b1f/b1f1eeee149ef49c008a2258ee6c0d78.jpg

1169,Middle-earth: Shadow of War,"Middle-earth: Shadow of War is a continuation of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor
The game operates on the world and the characters of the books of JRR Tolkien. However, it will be more accurate to say that the game is closer to the cinematic version of this story, created by director Peter Jackson. This is noticeable both in the visual solutions of some locations, and in the events themselves and their location in time relative to each other.
Judging by the events, the game takes place between the events of the books &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. However, in the game there are also such events as the fall of the city-fortress of Minas Ithil and its transformation into Minas Morgul - in books these events occur several thousand years earlier.
As in Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, in the game Middle-earth: Shadow of War, the Nemesis system operates. This system provides a change in the world of the game and its inhabitants from the actions of the player. Therefore, each passage differs from other passages. For the game Middle-earth: Shadow of War, the Nemesis system has been improved.
If the player has the game Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, he can transfer to Middle-earth: Shadow of War some characters from the previous game - one enemy and one ally.
The player controls Talion. Taleon is obsessed with the spirit of the elven ruler of Celebrimbor. Taleon tries to use one of the rings of power to build an army of orcs and trolls and fight with Sauron and his generals.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/21a/21ad672cedee9b4378abb6c2d2e626ee.jpg
1170,The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot (2015),"The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot is an MMO-only game. It offers the player to build a fantasy castle filled with traps and to raid the castles constructed by the other players. The game is full of puns and jokes about high fantasy tropes. The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot requires the constant internet connection. There are two main modes: assault and building. 
Castle building
In this mode, the player builds a dangerous dungeon for other players to crawl. The builder can customize his or her castle, give it a name and enhance it with monsters, traps, bombs, and other defenses. More defense options can be unlocked as the player progresses. Every castle has a treasury room in its middle as a bait to give other players a reason to explore it.
Castle assault
In this mode, the player controls a character in a manner similar to Diablo or DotA games. The characters belong to four classes, each with its own comical personality: mage, archer, knight, or runaway. The player picks a castle and tries to fight his or her way through its traps and monsters. Each castle has a level that indicates its difficulty and the amount of reward. The goal is to reach the castle&#39;s treasury. By doing so, the player earns gold and other useful loot such as equipment that can be used in future raids. 
Shutdown
The game&#39;s official online servers are discontinued since 2016. There&#39;s a mobile version of the game released in 2017, though it lacks the castle building element and uses pre-programmed levels.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f2/7f280778b23561fe3ea8ffa04d5ed61f.jpg

The meteor came. And from it, the survivors learned to harness the power source known as Zygnoka. In the next forty years, the megacity known as The Structure was erected inside the impact crater. Here, the people isolated themselves, accelerating their dependence on technology and created a society as a machine of its own.
In The Structure, order and efficiency is maintained by severe top-down control. In the name of efficiency, new machines and instruments are put to use on the public the instant they are invented. In pursuit of optimisation, a new profession is tasked to maintain the increasingly precarious anomaly levels of the city&#39;s inhabitants. These are called Mind Scanners.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f93/f93ee651619bb5b273f1b51528ee872a.jpg

Gameplay mechanics address the themes like groupthink, obedience to authority, fake news or immigration. They are based on the interactions between the elements and characters in the game and the main character is the driving force behind these interactions.
Sarcasm, inappropriate jokes and absurdity of the system game is set in plays a strong role during the game story development. We are playing with some alternative reality through recognisable elements of todays political and social scene. We are becoming global by building walls in between ourselves. Story makes fun even of the player playing the game by addressing the “rage&amp;quit” behaviour of new generation of gamers.
In order to underline “Big Brother” feel, we made a slight distance in between player and the character. Gameplay is hard but fun, challenging and unique.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7d/b7dcf418db2136df3d86bffd91ed9f45.jpg
1175,Minoria,"Minoria is the latest and most ambitious game from Bombservice, and a spiritual sequel to the Momodora series, from the same studio.
Fans of Momodora will find familiar aspects in the design and gameplay elements, as they master the ins-and-outs of parries, dodges, and a variety of different spells.
The presentation has evolved to an HD format, with aesthetics mixing 2D hand-painted backgrounds and cel-shaded characters.
The story takes place during the fourth Witch War. It is a time of fanatical religious fervor. On the one hand, by the Sacred Office, a powerful organization leading an Inquisition against heresy, in order to purify the sinners who threaten humanity. And on the other hand, those labeled “witches”, responsible for conducting a mysterious ceremony that contradicts the rules of the Church.
Set forth with Sisters Semilla and Fran, missionaries in the Church’s service, on their journey to thwart the witches’ ceremony and protect the common-folk from heresy that endangers the status quo.

A unique visual aesthetic combining hand-painted 2D art with cel-shading
Fluid controls encouraging careful engagement and patient play
Offensive combat enabling players to crush enemies with a mix of swordplay and spells
Defensive options including dodge-rolls and parries
A leveling system that helps players adjust their character to their desired difficulty
Hello there! I’m rdein, the creator and director of Minoria.
First of all, I’d like to share my excitement in announcing this project. This is an universe I care a lot for, from the setting to the characters, and it’s been a lot of fun to explore and develop its concepts during the process of game development.
For the first time in many years, I started a game project set in a new universe. It felt like a breath of fresh air for me. With that said, Minoria does contain some similarities with my previous projects (especially Momodora’s latest installment, Reverie Under the Moonlight).
I am proud of what we’ve been making for Minoria, and I hope you will enjoy the story and characters I’ve prepared this time around!
Howdy folks, Dan here from Dangen Entertainment. It’s been hard patiently waiting for the announcement of Minoria, knowing what an amazing game it’s going to be. It combines everything I love about the Momodora games with stronger emphasis on a solemn story. I love how Bombservice is approaching the visuals this time around too--it’s a unique take that looks beautiful and shows another evolutionary step in the team’s development experience, just as previous titles have.
This game is extraordinary. A must-play if you’ve got an appetite for action-platformers like I do.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a11/a115439cf07ec721103dd7367f84732a.jpg
1176,Mirage: Arcane Warfare,"Multiplayer adventure from Torn Banner Studios was released in May 2017.
The main gameplay mechanic of the game is a team multiplayer shooter from the first person perspective. The main bet was on melee fighting and the magical abilities of the characters. Players could choose from six classes that differed in skills and roles in the game. There are several modes available in the game: deathmatch and various mission options such as Capture the Flag and “Payload” modes.
The game was available for pre-order on Steam back in 2017 and for the year of its existence, it managed to attract about one million players but never found its core audience despite multiple positive reviews from the press. It was removed in May 2018 from public access due to the inability to comply with the GDPR policy. The Developers confirmed that they ran out of options to keep the game alive and they do not plan to return to it.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb6/bb69662c8fb265e790d07039dd30066c.jpg
1177,Mirror's Edge Catalyst,"Mirror&#39;s Edge Catalyst is the second part in the Mirror&#39;s Edge series. Like its predecessor, it is based around parkour simulation.
Plot
The game is set in the near future that is depicted as a cyberpunk dystopia. The story takes place in the city of Glass that is ruled by mega-corporations. Faith, the protagonist of the original game, returns in Catalyst. She is a Runner, a person who specializes in illegal delivery. Early in the game, Faith steals a valuable hard drive from a corporation. After reading its data, she learns about the Reflection project that will allow the corporations to control every resident in Glass.
Gameplay
The game combines platforming, parkour, and puzzles in the vein of Portal series. The player controls Faith from the first person view as she runs and leaps across the rooftops of Glass. Puzzle-like level design requires her to use pipes, wires, and ledges to get to her destination. Precision timing is important to perform jumps, slides, and rushes in a seamless flow.
The combat system in Catalyst changed dramatically. Unlike in the original game, Faith cannot use guns. She can fight in hand-to-hand combat but usually has to avoid enemies.
Style
Like its predecessor, Catalyst is notable for its minimalist use of colors. Glass is mostly shining white and dark blue, while the occasional use of other colors signifies something important. The game is accompanied by the cold, atmospheric electronic soundtrack by Solar Fields.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/257/257c497aa4060f4a697ccbf5e99ec230.jpg

1221,NEEDY GIRL OVERDOSE,"Turn “Ame-chan” – somewhat of a hot mess of a girl – into an OMGWTF-cute internet angel and jumpstart her career as a live streamer for the most hardcore otakus online!
Ame-chan:
While she may look somewhat low-key and quiet, she’s actually a ridiculously selfish and vapid girl with a tendency to get carried away and a desperate need for approval. She’s, well... kind of a garbage person. Likes: Her S.O./producer, “P-chan”; psychotropics.
OMGkawaiiAngel-chan:
An “internet angel”. Ame-chan’s alter ego, used while streaming. Pretends to be really nice and sweet. Constantly flirts with otaku types.
As Ame-chan’s beloved (???) “P-chan”, offer daily commentary and guidance to help foster her into a top-tier streamer. She’ll start out getting few comments and even less followers, but under your direction and guidance she can amass more and more devoted listeners/obsessed fans, turning her into a super-popular streamer – and thus allowing you to squeeze stupid amounts of cash out of her donation-happy otaku followers.
It’s not all about streaming – sometimes you just need to take a little break, too! Take Ame-chan on dates, serve her up a little bit of naughtiness once in awhile, provide her with a little something-something to take the edge off when she needs to release some pent-up stress, and use online dating apps to send her on dates with other dudes to help keep her happy and mentally healthy. *NOTE: This is actually a perfectly wholesome game, containing absolutely no explicit sexual references or expressions nor illegal substances.
You can see the results of your daily actions and behavior via social media, where Ame-chan will use both public and private accounts to talk about you. People have a tendency to act supportive and friendly on the outside, while talking loads of smack and spreading rumors privately. You’ll sometimes receive long-winded, tedious criticisms and insults, but that’s just par for the course when dealing with a cute girl streaming on the internet. Be sure to take proper care of her.
The game features multiple endings, and your streamer will do things like become weird and emo for various reasons, subject her trusty P-chan to harm, and generally get messed up in the head. Begin your adventure and see for yourself whether a happy ending is really even possible for a cute yet disturbed girl on the modern-day internet.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1e/e1e6451c0a96c6b35cf82e3cb9dc618a.jpg

An old-school turn-based battle system combines with inspiration from unexplored mythology to offer an RPG experience that feels unique yet also familiar.
An unknown force has abducted the Sun King Napkiraly, leaving Operencia in a state of perpetual darkness – and eventual doom. From hidden royal tombs and cursed castles to an ascent up the World Tree to reach the Copper Forest of the Land of the Gods, explore diverse settings throughout the far reaches of the land…and beyond. Each location boasts its own unique atmosphere, visual style, level design and puzzles, and many take place entirely outdoors.
Operencia is home to an intriguing mix of unexplored mythology and fantastical versions of actual historical locations (e.g., Deva Fortress, Balvanyos) and characters (e.g., Attila, Seven Chieftains of the Magyars), all coming together to form one cohesive new gaming universe. Several of your own seven party members take influence from heroes of forgotten tales told hundreds of years ago, such as the brave knight Mezey and Sebastian the Dragon Slayer.
Along with a deeply strategic turn-based battle system full of spells and special skills to execute, tile-based movement encourages thorough exploration of each area. For added challenge, turn on Cartographer mode to plot out each of the 13 maps yourself. How many secrets will you find?
Breathtaking hand-drawn cutscenes and fabulous 2D character portraits bring the story to life in a style not easily compared to any other game. More than 30 colorful roles are fully voiced through top-tier performances authentic to the game’s Central European roots.

Explore the nature of good and evil, learn the true cost of power, and rise as a Mythic Hero capable of deeds beyond mortal expectations.
Your path will take you to the Worldwound, where the opening of a rift to the Abyss has unleashed all-consuming terror across the land. For over a century, the neighboring nations have tried to withstand the threat coming from the portal and drive the enemy back, but to little avail. Now you have the chance to put an end to this conflict, but the path to salvation is far from clear-cut. Will you become a shining angel backed by worthy paladins? Or a powerful necromancer with hordes of immortal undead in your thrall? Or something else? Lead your army and challenge the mighty demon lords. Your crusade will set in motion a chain of events that will change the world – and you – forever.
Create any character imaginable with the flexibility, richness, and depth of the Pathfinder First Edition ruleset. Choose from 25 classes, 12 character races, and more than a thousand spells, feats, and abilities to suit your personal playstyle.
Enjoy two combat modes to slay your enemies – real-time with pause or turn-based. Switch between them on the fly!
A cast of more than 10 unique companions is ready to join your cause. Earn their trust and respect, and they will have your back no matter what dangers lie ahead.
But you will need much more than a party of adventurers to cleanse the land of the demonic scourge. Take command of the crusaders and lead them to victory – either as a strategist controlling the battle from above, or as a field commander in a new tactical combat mode.
A gift of tremendous power has been given to you, and you must choose where this power will lead you. Take a step on one of eight Mythic Paths to obtain extraordinary abilities and shape everything that comes next. Your decisions might transform you into a celestial Angel, a ravaging Demon, a powerful Lich, a cunning Trickster, a lawful Aeon, a rebellious Azata, a wise Gold Dragon, or an ever-ravenous Swarm That Walks.

1282,Pendragon,"AD 673. Camelot has fallen. The jealous Sir Mordred has broken the fellowship of the Round Table with hatred and lies. Now King Arthur faces his final battle. Who will keep the dream of Camelot alive?
Pendragon is a turn-based strategy game, where every move you make drives the narrative, and every story twist opens new gameplay opportunities.
Will you advance and show your mettle, or cautiously retreat? Will you slip round enemies, or encounter them head-on? And when sacrifices are required, who will you put in harm&#39;s way?
From the creators of the multi-award-winning 80 DAYS and Heaven’s Vault.
Rally the Knights of the Round Table. Some will make it to Camlann and King Arthur. Others will fall. But every turn will change history.
Will Sir Lancelot be reunited with Queen Guinevere? Will she spurn him, or embrace him? Will Sir Kay ever forgive Sir Gawaine for siding with Sir Mordred? Can Morgana le Fay be trusted? Where is Merlyn? Who lies buried in Mordred’s graveyard? Who is the archer in the woods? What has become of Excalibur?
Secrets will be uncovered. Hearts will be broken. People will die. But maybe, just maybe, King Arthur can be saved...
Journey across Dark Ages Britain to face wild creatures, brutal rogues, and Sir Mordred’s dark knights. A randomized game board ensures every playthrough is new.
Fight turn-based battles with simple yet deeply strategic combat where position is everything, losses are inevitable, and every step permanently shapes the narrative.
Experience story and gameplay as one: Pendragon’s story plays out on the field of battle itself, driven by your decisions - and those of your enemies.
Choose a character to lead the adventure. Their personality will shape the story: Morgana le Fay is treacherous; Queen Guinevere is haunted by her mistakes; Sir Lancelot is French; Sir Gawaine is usually drunk...
Assemble a ragtag band of knights, heroes, and peasants whose dispositions and abilities grow and change with the story.
Live the legend: there will be love, suspicion, revenge, sacrifice and murder — and no one is safe, not even your leader.
Determine the fate of the kingdom: your actions determine whether Arthur faces Mordred alone or with his friends by his side.

1283,The Persistence,"The Persistence challenges you, a clone of security officer Zimri Elder, to survive aboard a doomed deep space colony starship, overrun with horrific and murderous aberrations. You are the last survivor.  Your mission? Restore functionality to the ship and somehow make your way back to Earth.
Death is just the beginning
The only thing that stands in the way of saving the starship is an array of clone printed monstrosities, constantly replenished by the ship’s malfunctioning clone printer. If any encounter with these foes proves fatal, Zimri’s consciousness is uploaded into a new host body, ready for the next attempt.
An ever-changing labyrinth
The colony starship has a self-configuring macrostructure which can alter its internal architecture – and due to the catastrophic malfunction, that’s exactly what will happen. Upon awakening in a new cloned body or on teleporting between decks, the layout of the starship will change each time. Each and every expedition into The Persistence will be unique, with different items and gear to collect &amp; upgrade.
Enhance, upgrade and augment
The technology of the 26th century allows for genetic augmentation and manipulation of dark matter technology. Resequence Zimri’s DNA to improve health, toughness and defensive abilities or even harvest crew DNA to create cloned bodies of crewmembers to inhabit, each with their own unique abilities.
Explore, evade, fight and gather resources
The mutated horde won’t think twice about tearing Zimri limb from limb. Use the environment to scope out, stalk and gain the tactical advantage in either evading or attempting to take them down.  Explore the decks of the ship and gather resources, weapons and suit customizations to aid survival in the journey deeper into the dark and terrifying depths.
Asymmetric Multiplayer
Connect a phone or tablet running IOS or Android to the game for up to 2 players to take control of ‘Solex’ – the ship’s engineering system.

Throughout secret missions, classified files investigations and enemy agent interrogations, peel off layers upon layers of a sinister plot and save the world from a somber future. If you can.Features
A rich alternate history plot anchored by historical events and characters, bringing the chillingly relevant Cold War reality to life from a unique point of view.
Next-generation turn-based combat: Unprecedented flexibility of movement and actions, variable overwatch modes and assault-oriented Breaching ability
Expanded battlefield: position assets around the world and call for assistance in the middle of battle when you need it most. Just remember, the enemy can bring their own reinforcements, heavy weapons or even air support and their toy box is much bigger than yours.
Knowing is half the battle: scout mission locations ahead of time, infiltrate with undercover operatives and improve your odds. Elite enemy agents with their own agenda are always ready to spring their own ambushes.
Go loud or go home (stealthily): fully-fledged stealth gameplay with silenced weapons, silent takedowns and cutting-edge Cold War era security technology. All this makes completing entire operations clandestinely a viable option.
Run your own counterintelligence organization: recruit subjects of top secret government experiments, operatives of the world’s secret services, KGB &amp; CIA included, or even criminals. Manage a global operation, securing weapons, resources and contacts. Command from a distance or go hands-on to fight for the real stakes.
Actively pursue the truth: research cases, locations and individuals in Investigation Board gameplay mechanics to uncover new missions, resources and technologies.
Employ technology ruthlessly to your advantage: learn from the enemy or research your own methods for brainwashing, interrogation, body engineering and chemical enhancement.
Customize your operatives and then do it again once they need a new identity: forge documents, change appearance, retrain them for lethal effect and send them back into the fray.
Replayable, modular campaign with an array of mechanics to ensure unique and markedly different playthroughs: generated character names and backgrounds, modular and algorithmically populated maps, randomized intelligence snippets.
A highly replayable, story-driven campaign with meticulously designed and adaptable maps.
Two stories to choose from: a KGB counterintelligence operative or a CIA wet work commando who have to come to grips with the truth and challenge the conspiracy, with an additional New Game Plus protagonist.
No mission too big, no mission too small: enter a bustling government facility undercover to assassinate a target with surgical precision or mount a heavy frontal assault on an enemy staging base. With optional objectives closely linked to a mission’s complexity and opportunities like loot and intelligence to collect, there are decisions to be made at each step.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a17/a176da07b6d4597b9ad950c559292092.jpg

1297,Planetary Annihilation,"Set in the distant future, this science fiction strategy was inspired by Total Annihilation (1997) and is designed by one of the original game&#39;s engine creators, Jon Mavor. Planetary Annihilation gameplay is largely similar to classic RTS series like Starcraft or Command &amp; Conquer, yet not without its own unique features. This game is focused on interplanetary wars on a larger scale and allows its players to conquer the whole worlds or even destroy them using nukes and Death Star-like devices. The maps are randomly generated, and each map constitutes a whole planet in 3D projection (albeit scaled down). Each player starts with a Commander unit that is used to create necessary buildings. Commanders represent the player and, like in chess, loss of your Commander means losing the game.
The definitive feature of the game is that battles are not contained to certain planets, but are fought across the whole planetary systems using missiles and &quot;planet thrusters&quot;; and there are many such systems in the galaxy. The scale of the setting can make it difficult to keep track of one&#39;s operations across different systems at the later stages of the game.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20e/20ec6440ede691638c42684fd6551156.jpg

1303,Poker Night at the Inventory,"Four famous characters - Max (Sam &amp; Max game series), RED Heavy (Team Fortress 2 game), Tycho (Penny Arcade webcomic), and Strong Bad (Homestar Runner web series) - just sit around a table in the underground casino called Inventory and play poker. According to its owner, it is hidden under a video game store and is kept secret so that if the government outlaws gambling one day, it will know nothing of Inventory. The player does not control any of the characters but is instead an invisible character on its own, who is literally referred to as The Player by other characters. 
All players have a reserve of $10,000 at the beginning and leave the game if they&#39;re left nothing to put at stake. The ultimate goal for the player is to remain the last one sitting behind the table. Sometimes the opponents will put their recognizable belongings, such as Heavy&#39;s iconic bazooka Iron Curtain, at stake. This is essentially a board game, however, funny animation and characters&#39; chit-chat filled with references and jokes may keep one interested.
Achievements in Poker Night at the Inventory allow unblocking certain special features in Team Fortress 2.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1be/1be2141edae05d4ba9858182b081e604.jpg

The few remaining people hide in the few safe oases, while the rest of the world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland raided by gangsters and evil mutants. The main protagonist is a man named Walker, who is the last ranger of the wasteland and a wielder of superhuman powers. He fights against the totalitarian organization called The Authority.
Gameplay

There are also a lot of collectibles that in fact complicate the game if you want to pick them all.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/375/375f84d018242d7519a230f623981217.jpg

1331,Rebel Cops,"Rebel Cops is a spin-off game from This Is the Police, which exclusively features the series&#39; turn-based tactical operations. Lead a rag-tag squad of cops in rebellion against their town&#39;s new criminal power, and see how long you can hold out when you&#39;re constantly short on supplies, and a single shot can cost a cop his life.
You’re not exactly the police, but you&#39;re the only ones on the side of justiceViktor Zuev, a sadistic crime boss new on the scene, has quickly taken the town of Ripton by the throat. The community&#39;s leaders and even the local police have surrendered to his will. A master of intimidation and blackmail, Zuev has seized every major business in town, all of which he now controls as his own private fiefdom. But an outlaw band of renegade cops refuse to bow. With little hope of success, they fight on -- for justice, and the soul of their town.
Gunfights are thrilling, but stealth is keyYou&#39;re fighting a guerilla war, out-manned and out-gunned. Use concealment and cover, approach the enemy quietly, and take them down before they can raise the alarm. You have at your disposal an arsenal of non-lethal weapons and equipment, as well as special tactical perks, which you can unlock as you upgrade your rebels. True, sometimes violence seems inevitable, but when the time comes, don&#39;t hesitate: neither you nor the criminals have health bars. When someone is shot, they&#39;ll bleed out quickly, and getting a bullet in the head means instant death.
Explore, scavenge, and watch your backRebel Cops features not only compact operations where you need to fight for every inch of ground, but also large open locations to explore -- the sandbox levels. Search each room, crack open safes and vaults, try to get into inaccessible areas -- and grab everything that looks useful. Stay together and proceed with caution, or accept the risks, fan out, and try to explore every corner.
Take the high road, or the low roadZuev&#39;s mercilessness is the key to his power. Can you defeat him without playing by his rules? Will you answer the needs of the desperate townspeople, even if it means putting the whole operation at risk? Will you spare civilian guards who are only doing their jobs? Some say that in war, you have to do whatever it takes to survive, but remember: reputation is more valuable than money. Bad blood on the street can easily put your good name in the mud. Merchants will refuse to do business with you, and even some of your own people might turn their backs on you.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abe/abe59869a37299e370cac8edaf91cdfa.jpg
1332,Rebel Galaxy,"The most reasonable rule of trade: if the goods are from far away – they should cost more. If you apply it to the space trade between the galaxies, you will get Rebel Galaxy, a space trading and combat simulation, created by a small studio of two people. Western style is complemented by licensed blues and country rock music tracks. 
The universe is randomly generated, and players are taking control of the spacecraft, that can and will be replaced if needed. The game offers numerous activities for players, depending on what they are compelled to do. Salvage what’s left of the spaceship after the battle, mine the asteroids for resources, explore galactic anomalies or befriend aliens and trade with them. Not interested in trade and exploration? Any player can take on bounty hunting contracts or battling pirates. Combat in the Rebel Galaxy uses shooting gallery mechanics: the player and capital ships are restricted by two-dimensional movement, all non-player gunships are capable of maneuvering on X, Y and Z axis. And all that in addition to the story missions.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/59f/59f8ff56cde745ceb56029f229ad4e43.jpg

1334,Red Faction: Armageddon,"Armageddon - the fourth part of the game Red Faction.
The action takes place on Mars. Mars is colonised and inhabited thoroughly, but the device for creating an artificial atmosphere is captured by a group of unbalanced scoundrels. Colonists have to move under the surface, where for some reason there is air.
This is a setting. We meet the hero pursuing his own tasks - he is looking for treasure in a dungeon under someone else&#39;s order. But instead of gold and gems, he discovers a device of an incomprehensible purpose. The hero contacts the customer and receives an order to blow up the found structure. The explosion leads to the awakening of a race of monsters, like giant insects, which begin to briskly destroy the colonists. And the hero now has to kill the monsters.
Armageddon sets a new level of the Red Faction game. The important novelties:
More opportunities to break through the walls.
The hero gains additional energy from destroying something.
The hero gets a device that can collect back the destroyed objects.
Sometimes the hero finds a fighting robot, sits down in it and literally tramples the enemies.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/395/395ad028483d6cd9076b746a3eec993d.jpg

1337,Reign Of Kings,"Struggle to survive in a harsh medieval world. Hunt wildlife, mine resources, build structures, and craft weapons and armor in order to protect yourself. You may form a guild, bring war to all opposition, and try to seize the throne and become king!In Reign of Kings we allow you to collect resources and craft a wide variety of items needed to build a vast and powerful kingdom. We were primarily inspired by Rust &amp; Chivalry in the development of this game.In addition to standard resources, you may compete over the Ancient Throne which resides in a throne room which overlooks the island. All players who are not part of the King's Guild are taxed on the resources they collect.The development of a melee combat system adds a gritty and visceral feeling to Reign of Kings that will allow players to become deeply immersed in a realistic and intense medieval survival experience.The world itself is designed to inspire competition and struggles for power.  Resource locations strategically spread throughout the game will create inequity and envy.  Players will have the ability to make war, or even capture and hold other players in order to get what they want.  Each player will have the power to decide the fate of the kingdom, or choose to entirely forego the responsibility of ruling the kingdom and roam the land as a freeman.CAPTUREPlayers have the ability to capture, hold, and execute other players. The player can capture them with rope or iron shackles. Once shackled, a player is no longer able to access their inventory aside from their orifice slot. The captured player's inventory is accessible for the captor to search them. Additionally, a rope will be attached to a prisoner which will allow them to be pulled in any direction their captor wishes. In order to avoid severe grieving situations, players can hide a sharp stone or lock pick in their orifice. This ""hidden"" item can help them escape capture or commit suicide.PUNISHMENT &amp; DEATHPunishment &amp; Death Once the player has control of a captive, there are several options available for managing a prisoner.  Options range from simply locking them in a cage or dungeon, public humiliation in the pillory, or simply executing them.THE ANCIENT THRONEThe Ancient Throne can be claimed by any player. Holding the Ancient Throne will grant its owner dominion over the entire map (change name of realm) and taxation rights over every other player.  The King of the Ancient Throne will receive the ability to collect the resource tax from every player within the game by visiting the Ravens Treasure Tree. The ravens automatically collect taxes in the game (behind the scenes of course, sneaky little things), and place them in the chests in their Treasure Tree.  In addition, the King of the Ancient Throne will have access to the Ancient Sword and the Ancient Crown. PRODUCTION &amp; REFINING STATIONSPlayers will have the ability to collect resources and to craft them into useful items or building materials. Additionally, the progression mechanic for being able to craft higher valued items will be reliant on upgrading production stations to a higher level.  (Need a better quality sword?  Upgrade your anvil.)  Production and refining stations can craft or refine items as long as there are resources available unless ordered to do otherwise.  This allows the player the freedom to do other things while his kingdom remains productive. COLLECTION STATIONSCollection stations can be placed for grain and water. Collection stations will passively produce raw materials given they have enough fuel.These collection stations will be fully interactive and if left un-defended will offer a nice target for unscrupulous or enemy players.  With this in mind, the player will want to protect their resources. SIEGE EQUIPMENT AND RAIDING BASESOnce the players build stone walls and iron doors, players will not be able to simply bash their way inside. Players will now need to employ one of many different techniques for entry.The ranged option is to build trebuchets and launch large stones from afar at your opponent's castle. Players must place a counterweight to offset their projectile weight in order to get the range and destruction power they need from the stone they are launching. Players may also rotate the trebuchet. This alignment takes some practice but is very rewarding when set correctly.Players may choose to go a more stealthy route by crafting lock picks. Lock picks, however, are very hard to craft, and do not work on iron doors and iron gates.Players defending a base may employ their own trebuchet or set up a ballista which is great for killing other players at range.FIRST PERSON COMBAT Our combat systems allow melee and ranged combat to take center stage when war breaks out. Inspired by games like Chivalry, Reign of Kings' combat system is being tuned for satisfying, fast paced action. Players fight over the scarce resources and face off to defend or capture the throne.MELEE Players equip brutal weapons and use mouse buttons in an attempt to chop, slice, &amp; stab through an opponent. Players will want to upgrade their weaponry to inflict the highest amount of damage as melee combat will always be dangerous and unpredictable.  Armor will be highly prized in Melee as it will keep you in a fight much longer. We support delimbing and decapitation of an opponent to represent the visceral and brutal experience of medieval close-quarters warfare.  A variety of period realistic weapons and armor will be available for the player to craft as they progress toward elder content.RANGEDRanged fighting in ROK will encompass the use of the bow, crossbow, javelin, and throwing stones. A good way for a player to stay alive in a fight during the early game will be to use ranged weaponry and speed.  Keeping out of sword range from a marauding knight is always a good idea, but even more so if you’re not equipped with the quality of armor that can absorb a hit or two. A simple bow and spear may be capable of taking down wild game, but may not provide enough piercing power to get through the finest plate male.  It’ll be important for the player to learn what kinds of weaponry are most effective in a fight as it will be critical knowledge to stay alive and have impact in a fight.  Higher tier Steel-pointed javelins will be able to pierce some armors, but the crossbow is the best option for punching a hole through the most heavily plated opponent at range.  The general rules of ranged weaponry will apply in ROK to determine functionality.  The bow will have the highest accuracy and reload speed, the crossbow will have greatest piercing power but is slow to reload, and thrown weapons will have the highest damage output, but are for short range use only.LOOTROK features a plague-ridden village that was cursed and abandoned by the old gods. This village features plague-ridden villagers, loot crates, and some high-end loot drops. It is dangerous to be in the village for long periods of time due to the disease that will damage the player's health.DEATHROK uses a roguelike death model similar to Rust.  When players die, they will fall to the ground as a ragdoll container that can be looted by other players.  Dead players will be provided with a random re-spawn option that can be improved through bed placement.CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATIONPlayers begin the game by creating a unique character.  They will be able to refine their look in great detail by editing their body parts, choosing hair, and establishing a banner scheme to help them identify loyal friends during gameplay. You can also choose the voice style of your player's taunts.BUILDINGUsing the standard block, ramp and stairs, ROK building materials will consist of sticks, thatch, clay, wood, re-enforced wood, and stone.  Thatch, sticks, wood and clay will be widely available and often the first choice in material for beginning level housing. While these materials will offer shelter from poorly equipped enemies, they are easily breached by other players. Stone will offer much greater resistance to basic attacks and will only be damageable with siege tactics.  Players will be able to build their homes, towers and castles any way they like, but will need a great deal of space during elder content play in order to hold a large number of production, refining, and collection stations. Building castles will be a natural occurrence for players who reach elder content gameplay.  With the large number of production stations, refining stations, collection stations, chests, torture devices and respawn beds available for the player to build, comes the need to protect a large footprint of space.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfc/bfcc1435dfefca9e0b58828d7f0f293b.jpg

Nilin, the heroine, can penetrate into the memory of people, she changes the past on which people base their actions in the present. Once she is subjected to a complete erasure of memory. She has to start a battle for herself - for the self that she does not even remember.
Setting, plot, design and lighting immediately evokes a masterpiece of cyberpunk - «Blade Runner». But the game is noticeably superior to the movie regarding «volume» of space, the sensation of «air» and «presence» in the game. There is an impression that you see the world of the game 360 ​​degrees around you. Mimicry and plastic of characters are directed in each detail, undoubtedly dramatic, give a full impression of a play of live actors. It seems that even the movements of inanimate objects are filled with the same expressiveness - for example, the trajectories of a thrown pistol or splinters ... High level of directing and corresponding levels of design and graphics. A mass of significant finds, filling every frame with emotion and senses.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/569/569ea25d2b56bd05c7fa309ddabe81ff.jpg

1341,Remothered: Tormented Fathers,"Remothered: Tormented Fathers is the movie-like gaming experience with realistic and extreme gameplay created for survival horror fans.
The story is rich of unpredictable plot-twists, but it is touching at the same time. Psychology plays a huge role within the game: heroes and enemies are atypical and the line between good and evil is blurred. The development of the game is similar to that of a film narration, where the player perfectly identifies himself with the character. The soundtrack, composed by Nobuko Toda (Final Fantasy, Halo, Metal Gear Solid) and Luca Balboni, enhances the terrifying atmosphere of the game.
Rosemary Reed, a fascinating 35 year old woman, reaches the house of a retired notary, Dr. Felton, who is affected by a mysterious disease. The woman is greeted by Ms. Gloria, the nurse who takes care of the old man. When Rosemary reveals herself and her true intentions, the terrifying dread begins.
Rosemary’s investigations will bring her to believe that the disappearance of the man’s daughter Celeste actually hides a terrible massacre. Dr. Felton and his wife, Arianna, could be the only ones to know the truth, including the secret behind Celeste’s real identity and a fanatic cult of cloistered nuns in red.
Remothered: Tormented Fathers is the first title of the long-awaited 3rd person game trilogy. A web of lies where murders and obsessions come to life. A revolutionary experience created for survival horror fans.
Run and hide gameplay - You will have to deal with obsessed stalkers always on your steps. They’ll never give up or die.

1342,Renegade Ops,"A rare opportunity to so wholly quench the thirst for total destruction. The game understands this desire and does everything to make it happen. Yes, there is a story in the game, but the main thing is that there are tremendous opportunities to see on the screen a bright consequence of all your destructive impulses.
Your small car or helicopter rushes around the locations, bringing down the streams of fire. The game reality is repeatedly and colourfully detonated from every touch. The game continually offers more and more appetising victims - cars, flying and swimming devices, limousines and buildings, which can be destroyed entirely or in pieces, inflicting wounds one by one or killing with one blow.
It is clear that you are busy with all these mass destructions so you cannot observe the rules of the road - the game is favourably treated with the manner of your car to fly into a skid or to demolish fences not only by guns but also by bumpers. Navigation and management are also skillfully designed - and intended to not to distract you from the massacre.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/31b/31b1a1a45ad7103e52eed8ef658209a2.jpg

1351,Rise of the Third Power,"1587, 2A - 15 years have passed since the guns of the Great War at last fell silent.
The conflict rocked the world, leaving half a generation of men and women lying dead on the battlefield. Of the many players that had acted on the world stage, only two remained; the kingdom of Cirinthia and the ancient Republic of Tariq. In time, Dimitri Noraskov, a hero to the defeated Kingdom of Arkadya, rose from the ashes. He saw his king as a coward for surrendering, and a traitor for submitting to the Treaty of Evenheart.
So did his people.
They supported Noraskov when he overthrew the king. They supported him as he reclaimed the lands that had been stripped of them. And they supported him as he raised an army. Noraskov had theorized that the nations of the world were still too wearied by the Great War to enforce the terms of the Treaty. Thus far, his gambit has proven
successful.
The Arkadyan Empire shows no signs of curbing its aggression. It is feared by many that a reprise of the Great War, that at one time could have been prevented, is now all but inevitable. But there are those that believe it can yet be stopped...
Rise of the Third Power is a love letter to the glory days of the console style RPG, with modern conveniences such as auto-save, and a combination of the best elements of Japanese and western style gameplay and writing. Experience this fusion of east and west, old and new, in a game meant to surpass Stegosoft Games&#39; previous work in every way!
CUSTOM BATTLE SYSTEM - Rise of the Third Power offers 8 playable characters in a battle system built from scratch, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, all of whom are meant to participate in battle simultaneously without the need for tedious party management. Combine each character&#39;s unique strengths and weaknesses, analyze the abilities of your foes, set your formation and charge into battle.
POLITICAL INTRIGUE - As the world of Rin is recovers from the Great War, the balance of power remains badly skewed, with vacuums of power still waiting to be filled. The player&#39;s party will be both beset and aided by schemers, liars and betrayers, all while the clock ticks down to a reprise of the greatest war in human history...
PERSISTENT EQUIPMENT - Each piece of equipment found, purchased or stolen is a permanent and unique unlockable upgrade for each character. Instead of purchasing replacements, the player purchases upgrades. No more buying that awesome helmet back in town only to stumble over a better one as treasure in a dungeon... Each character has 3 equipment slots with 8 upgrades each, with 192 to find in total! This system avoids the tedium of inventory management, while also giving the completionist something useful to hunt for.
STORY DRIVEN - Join a party of 8, each with their own unique ambitions, perspectives and personalities as they embark upon a suicide mission to topple the Arkadyan emperor, Dimitri Noraskov. A blend of humor, drama and tragedy await players as they navigate the treacherous world of Rin.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/006/0067b4dc4b1e1a705c477326104652d5.jpg

The legend behind the city begins in the 12th century and still comes nowadays, that this ancient city grants with a promise of immortality. While Lara tries to solve the mystery of Siberia, she encounters an organisation called Trinity. They want to retrieve this gift to themselves. Following the notes of her father, Lara tries to discover the secrets of the ancient city and stop Trinity in doing so.

Besides craftmanship and exploring, the game focuses on a very progressive combat system giving a player a wide variety of strategic options. There is a way to evade your opponents in the bushes; stealth kills with bow and arrows or open combat with firearms like shotguns, pistols and other guns. WIth earning experience, you can give Lara new ways of encountering her enemies by three different specialisations - Hunter, Survivor or Brawler. Each skill tree offers various options of combat, for example using Lara&#39;s surroundings and fauna, traps or better aim. With these options, you can choose how to guide Lara Croft in her adventures.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/b45/b45575f34285f2c4479c9a5f719d972e.jpg
1353,Rise of Venice,"Venice was at the peak of its power during the Renaissance and was viewed as a city of decadence, beauty and intrigue.

1357,Rocket League,"Highly competitive soccer game with rocket-cars is the most comprehensive way to describe this game. Technically a sequel to Psyonix’ previous game - Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars; Rocket League successfully became a standalone sensation, that can be enjoyed by anyone. Easy to learn, hard to master game mechanics are perfect for the tight controls. Players are invited to maneuver the different fields within several game modes, from arcade to ranked game either 1v1, or in 2v2 and 3v3 teams. Using boosters will not only speed up the car but will allow the car to propel itself into the air.
Rocket League provides several levels of customization, where not only the color of your car can be adjusted, but the colors and form of the booster flame, different hats, and little flags. Or players can pick a completely different car. Collaboration with different franchises brought not only original transport but some famous cars, including Batmobile or Delorian from Back to the Future.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/8cc/8cce7c0e99dcc43d66c8efd42f9d03e3.jpg
1358,Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken,"The game is set in the cartoonish universe of birds that was first introduced in Rocketbirds: Revolution. The city of Albatropolis was subdued by a ruthless army of penguins led by dictator Putzki. You assume the role of Hardboiled Chicken, a rebel commando rooster who is tasked with killing the tyrant. He will, however, eventually discover there’s much more behind the penguins’ plot. 
The game is divided into “chapters” which are split into very small levels, usually the size of one screen each. There are also several air levels in which Hardboiled Chicken flies on his jetpack. Most of the time, though, he walks through penguin military bases, climbing, hiding, solving puzzles, and shooting the guards on his way with various firearms. This is where the game’s “childish” visual style and tongue-in-cheek humor contrast its bloody action. There’s a co-op mode for two players that mostly uses the same maps but is based on a different plot about a kidnapped general&#39;s daughter.  
Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken is most famous for music. Many intros, animated cutscenes and even some of the levels are set to synth rock music by the Austrian band New World Revolution.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/105/105c19765bd45d666a00bdf1c1d65473.jpg

A DARK TALE
Weakened from defeat to the forces of good, you fled the world and sought refuge in hell to survive. Decades later, you have returned with your most faithful Disciples to exact revenge on those wretched Demon Hunters. But the world has changed in your absence. Your enemies have become all-powerful, and a new religion – the Sanctua Lumen – has become very influential. It mercilessly hunts down all those who serve you. To reinstate your hold over the world of humans, you must first regain the strength you previously wielded by taking possession of artefacts with legendary power.

1360,Roguebook,"Roguebook is a single-player roguelike deck-builder that takes place in a procedurally generated world.
Enter an ever-changing world full of legendary encounters and stories. Craft your cards, assemble the perfect deck and defeat the Roguebook itself... or die trying.
Roguebook is the second major game from Abrakam, the creators of the strategy card game Faeria, which launched in 2017 and has the best rating for a CCG on Steam with 86% positive Steam reviews and 1 million downloads.
Every time you play, the Roguebook generates a new world for you to explore. Said to contain all available knowledge in the world, rumors are whispered that those who dare to read the Roguebook can gain omniscience and attain near god-like status.
The pages within are filled with dangerous creatures, ancient legends, and exotic lands from the world of Faeria. The Roguebook itself is a mischievous entity with its own goals and motivations. It is able to rewrite itself entirely, always with the intent of tricking and fooling those who read it - trapping them for eternity.
Will you be able to outsmart the Roguebook?
Your adventure begins by selecting two heroes that will explore the Roguebook together. Each hero has their own special abilities and strategies. Combine different heroes for a completely different play experience.
The combat in Roguebook focuses on dual-hero gameplay. Each hero supports the other in different ways, from unleashing explosive combos to protecting the other from damage.
Core Battle System
During battles, the hero in front is the one normally exposed to damage.
Whenever you a play a card belonging to the hero in the back row, your heroes will swap positions.
If any hero reaches 0 health, they become inactive for the rest of the battle and have their cards removed from the deck. After the battle, that hero is healed back to a low amount of health and two Wound cards are added to your deck. A Wound is a card that&#39;s not playable and will only act as a handicap. It is said that finding a helpful wandering monk can help you remedy these wounds...
If both of your heroes reach 0 health in the same battle, your current run ends and the Roguebook wins.
Each card in Roguebook has a chance to have a certain amount of sockets. In these sockets, you can place a wide variety of gems to upgrade them in interesting ways. Gems also have assigned rarities. The rarest of them can completely transform your deck.
It&#39;s up to you to find the best way to use your gems with your deck, allowing for an infinite amount of customization. This vastly increases the ways you can break the game... exactly what we love about roguelikes!
Each time you enter the Roguebook, it will generate a unique world for you to explore. Gems, cards, relics, encounters, and all sorts of legendary stories are randomized to guarantee a fresh experience with each new reading.
You can move around the map freely and decide which area or encounter you&#39;d like to visit. Fog of war will prevent you from seeing the whole map, so some exploring will always be necessary. It&#39;s up to you decide which areas you&#39;ll discover, but be quick - for the Roguebook is always nipping at your heels as you go. Between fighting and looting, you will sometimes meet friendly NPCs: Fugoro the Shopkeeper, the Wandering Monk, the Court Jester, the Jeweler, etc.
The Roguebook contains the entire history of Faeria within its pages, including every legend and story that has ever been told around the campfire. Your heroes will encounter all manner of exotic beasts, endure powerful magic, and solve challenging problems.
We loved Gamebooks and would love to explore their narrative aspects in Roguebook. Each hero will have their own unique traits, like Wisdom, Cunning or Strength, giving them new possibilities to solve situations they encounter. Also, we want to have chain of events. For instance, the second or third time you meet the Apex Predator, the story will change depending on the results of previous encounters.
The game is strongly connected to the already established Faeria universe.
The Roguebook began as an esteemed book of lore from the world of Faeria. After the events in the Chronicles of Gagana take place, it was lost and forgotten inside the depths of a faeria well. There it lingered for over a decade.
The contact with this endless source of faeria transformed the book in a terrible way. Over time, it slowly develops its own free will - and reaveled its mischievous personality. By this time, characters like Sharra and Seifer have grown into heroes and villains of legend in their own regard. Their thirst for finding new challenges will draw them to this powerful artifact, now known as the Roguebook.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/021/021e9b567a8f65c3c5adf37282564047.jpg

« I had travelled through forgotten paths for days, weeks and months to reach the Thousand-Door Palace. A place where only silence reigned now. Where the wind had stopped and the tides retreated with the Great Rift. The great Departure.
And here stood before me this towering beauty of onyx and obsidian - the divine home where once echoed every whisper of the world. So vast that the greatest city of any kingdom would only be an anteroom in comparison. Peculiar green lights shone from inside the building, pulsating though the circular openings in the floating columns. The lost reverberations of an empty throne...
And here I was, bathed in my mist of past and future memories, standing in this mythical place that remained, still. The only location anyone in Hypnos could have found with no map or compass back when the King still reigned.
And I Remember the Silence In My Soul.

1410,Siege Survival: Gloria Victis,"Check out other amazing games featured on our special Digital Dragons partner page
Siege Survival: Gloria Victis Prologue is available here
THESE WALLS CAN’T FALL
Siege Survival: Gloria Victis is a survival resource management game in the style of This War of Mine, set in the medieval world of Gloria Victis.
Your homeland is drowning in war and chaos. As a group of civilians trapped under siege, you’ll face the ordeal of surviving the invasion. Though you do not participate in the fighting, the castle’s fate is in your hands.
Support the last soldiers standing against overwhelming enemy forces. Craft supplies and manage your resources during the day, and scavenge through the fallen city during the night. You must stand until the rescue comes!
ENDURE THE SIEGEYou must support the soldiers with weapons and provisions. The wounded and sick also demand your care. But your resources are limited. You must find ways to preserve food, and develop your infrastructure to use your supplies more effectively.
SCAVENGE THE FALLEN CITYTake the risk of sneaking into the fallen city plundered by the invaders. Under the cover of the night, you can find precious resources, trade with scavengers and other low-lifes, and help the surviving citizens – or exploit them. But be careful, enemy patrols keep watching the streets. You’re no warrior, so a fight is always the worst option. You must be smart to remain unseen... and alive.
MAKE DECISIONS, FACE THE OUTCOMEIn a war like this, one dilemma might lead to another and no decision is clearly good or clearly bad. One person’s survival may come at the cost of another’s death, no matter if he’s friend or family. Sacrifices must be made – with no guarantee they’ll pay off. In these desperate circumstances, however, survival means more than just staying alive, as morale is paramount. When you have to choose between sustaining the soldiers’ strength and taking care of your own survival, what will you sacrifice?
YOUR BACK AGAINST THE WALLA messenger had cut through the enemy lines to bring back reinforcements, but it will take weeks before help arrives. You’ll face hunger, wounds, diseases, and despair – but also the growing tensions between the civilians and the last defenders of the city. The soldiers won’t hold for long without your support and if the defense falls, the invaders will have no mercy. The odds are against you – what will you do to survive?
TELL YOUR OWN STORYSiege Survival: Gloria Victis is developed on a game editor platform we created with the goal of sharing it with the modding community along with the game itself – at the release if possible, or later as a free DLC. It will allow you to create new scenarios for the game from scratch and expand the universe of Gloria Victis with your own unique ideas and stories!",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/455/455972d83b546b3809f7c6cbd12be562.jpg

1445,Space Pirates and Zombies,"At its core, Space Pirates and Zombies is an action based, skill oriented, top down space combat game.  It’s similar to the ones we knew and loved in years past, but now using full physics simulation and modern graphics for those oh so pretty explosions.  But as you dig deeper, SPAZ becomes much more.
Instead of flying a single ship, you are in charge of an ever growing and evolving fleet, unlocking the rich tactical elements of SPAZ, all accessed at the touch of a button.  Issue orders, change ships, apply fleet AI settings, all on the fly.  At any moment the battle can change, and the Tactics Panel gives you the tools to make the battle turn in your favor.
As a layer on top of the action and tactics, we have a detailed technology and levelup system akin to what you would expect from an RPG.  Learn to build new ships by destroying your enemies.  Explore the galaxy to find components, use your hard earned research points to unlock their potential, and then customize every aspect of your new fleet.
Finally, there is the universe in which all this strife and adventure takes place.  SPAZ features a persistent randomly generated Galaxy populated with story elements, factions, enemies, missions, items, to provide you with a unique experience each time you play.  While you are struggling to survive, uncover the secret of an ever expanding Zombie infestation that spreads by establishing its own real time multi-tiered ecosystem.

1446,Space Pirates And Zombies 2,"In SPAZ 2 you must survive in an evolving post apocalyptic Galaxy.  The zombie threat is defeated, infrastructure has collapsed, fuel is scarce, and scavenging means survival.
Initially the Galaxy contains hundreds of fleets, each trying to survive.  AI captains do everything the player can.  The player is not special and is not the center of the Galaxy.
As resource scarcity becomes critical, ships come into conflict just to survive.  Factions may form for protection or split due to starvation.  Old friends must become fodder.
Stronger factions establish and defend territories, set up resource hubs, and establish star bases.  Weaker factions may resort to banditry.  Each captain is unique, persistent, and shapes the Galaxy.
When factions meet, combat is usually the result.  While the strategic side of SPAZ 2 is about exploration, territorial control, and faction building, the action side of SPAZ 2 is about ship construction, tactics, and salvage.
Combat creates damaged ships and dead crew, but it also provides new salvaged parts.  All the parts in SPAZ 2 are modular and randomly generated.  If you see something you like, break it off an enemy, grab it with your tractor beam, and connect it to your ship.  Ship construction can be done live during battles, though sometimes beating an enemy to death with their broken wing is also fun.
Back on the star map, battles will attract other captains looking for salvage.  Take your new parts and run.  Upgrade, repair, and prepare to fight another day, for darker threats are about to emerge.
Key Features:
Two hundred persistent Captains that are able to do everything the player can, including forming dynamic factions, building structures, controlling territory, and going to War.
A true living galaxy that is not player centric.  It will develop differently each game through the interactions of the agents.
Build your own faction from nothing.
Randomly generated modular parts.  Build the mothership that suits your play style, on the fly, in seconds.  Every part has its own unique stats that contribute to the mothership.  Every part has its own hull integrity and damage states.  Every part is a real, working, ship component.
Strategic ship building.  The mass, location and shape of parts all matter.  If a part blocks a turret, it will not fire.  If a ship is too long, it will turn slowly.  Too many engines will mean too little power for weapons.  Every design choice counts.
A fully physics based 3d environment where everything is destructible, takes damage from impacts, can be grabbed and even thrown at enemies with the tractor beam.
Natural movement and controls.  Movement is on a 2d plane and screen relative, much like an FPS.  The combat feels like huge pirate ships battling on an ocean.  Focus on tactical positioning and manage system power to unleash hell at the right moment.
Epic ship to ship battles.  Tear the enemy apart piece by piece over minutes, instead of seconds.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a41/a4110fd9f873138cad54e4279e0d6280.jpg

1458,SPINTIRES,"SPINTIRES is an indie auto simulator game developed by Oovee Game Studios.
Gameplay
SPINTIRES is an offroading simulator. The players have to deliver cargo using the post-Soviet machinery deep in the Russian woods, where there are no solid roads and a lot of fallen trees.
The main feature of the game is dynamic terrain. That is achieved with Havok physics engine. Trucks leave marks on the road, get stuck in the terrain, which makes the further advancement harder.  Thanks to Havok, the terrain is procedurally generated every time the player loads a map. That adds a high replayability value to the game. This feature also makes the races against other players much harder, as you can&#39;t just win a race by going as fast as you can.
In SPINTIRES, the game focuses a lot on simulating the physics and behavior of the vehicles. Every machine has a limited amount of gas, can be damaged beyond any repair. The players can turn the differential lock on or off, activate the 4X4 mode, which will influence the amount of used gas. It is also possible to drag the car out of the mud by using a rope and attaching it to a tree or another car.
The players can also modify the cars using different attachments. It is possible to attach fuel tanks, repair kits, and so on.
Multiplayer
The game features a 4-player multiplayer mode, where the players can choose the time of day, and the environment. The objective of the mode is to reach the finish first without getting stuck in the mud.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/6bd/6bd2862420402fa45d690295ed308cc6.jpg

1461,Split/Second,"Split/Second is a racing game with an accent on the destructible environment and the game within a game mechanics.
Gameplay
The title features usual for the genre lap and sprint races, but the unique feature lies in the destructible environment. Unlike previous installments, utilizing such mechanics, in Split/Second the player must fill the &quot;power play&quot; bar and unleash its power on the nearby construction — for example, crush the water boiler when there are opponents underneath it. 
The strength of the effect depends on how full the power bar is — there are two levels of damage available. The first-level collisions are mostly minor and lie in the field of damaging some constructions and crushing the billboards, while the second-level ones activate during the full bar completion are lead to the structural damage of the map facilities frequently leading to route changes and landscape altering.
Plot
Power Play mechanics is powered by the narrative underlining it as it tells the story of a TV Show, the participators of which are all the racers including our protagonist. The meter, in this case, represents the reviews watchers give to the show members. The computer-controlled opponents can also turn on the ability and crush something on the player&#39;s vehicle — so the audience votes not only for the protagonist.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0a0/0a0b66527a2e5917134fcf502cf83af1.jpg

1481,Stirring Abyss,"Stirring Abyss is an indie tactical squad-based game with strong RPG elements in which you uncover the ancient mysteries of the depths depicted in the classic vein of Lovecraftian horror.
You take charge of the surviving crew of the USS Salem, a U.S. Navy submarine that sinks while on a top secret research mission during the early years of the Cold War. They find themselves surrounded by the ruins of a forgotten civilization, their vessel too badly damaged to escape the seabed.
In Story Mode, you slowly unravel the mysteries of the depths in a desperate quest to rescue your missing crewmembers and fix the crippled Salem. The choices you make determine the fate of your crew - and the entire world.
Every expedition lives or dies by the strength of its crew. You have a diverse array of character traits and skills at your disposal, each opening exciting new options in both combat and in story events. As you delve ever deeper, you may also subject your crew to powerful but grisly mutations; the price of survival is high, and no one escapes the abyss unchanged.
The horror and the void which hide in deep waters can become too much to bear, and your crew may experience episodes of exhaustion and insanity. Will their psyche get stronger, or will it be forever damaged? A game of dice with Fate itself will determine the outcome.
Salvaged resources can be turned into weapons, armor, or other useful supplies - or they can be used to repair and upgrade the Salem, giving your crew a crucial edge in the fight for survival. The more you explore the abyss during the missions, the more chances you have to find the lost treasures of the deep.

&quot;More, please!&quot;
- Kotaku
&quot;[...] it more than succeeds in creating a wonderfully eerie atmosphere full of childlike anxiety, and along the way tackles a serious subject in a darkly poignant manner.&quot;
- IGN
&quot;Its depiction of a first-person horror told through the eyes and stumbling little legs of a two-year old is as intriguing as anything I&#39;ve seen all year, and reminiscent of a time when games actively sought out new ways to play and new stories to tell.&quot;

1555,Ary and the Secret of Seasons,"A long long time ago the balance and peace of Valdi was threatened by an evil mage. He was defeated by a legendary warrior and sealed inside the dome of seasons, under the watch of the guardians of seasons, waiting patiently for a breach.
Over the centuries, the story became legend. Legend became myth. And the evil mage passed out of all knowledge. No one believed about the guardian’s duty anymore. But for generations, in shadows, guardians of seasons continued to pass their knowledge from father to son . Sons? Well, that was before Aryelle.
Ary and the secret of seasons is an adventure game where you follow the journey of Ary across the world of Valdi. As a new season’s guardian, Ary has the power to navigate between seasons, summoning small spheres that act as tiny ecosystems for each season, and changing the environment within to suit her needs.

1556,The Ascent(itch),"Current Version: 1.5.1 (Demo)
This is a game with a simple story and that is to defeat the one called The Wicked One. You first arrive at an island where the objective is to get stronger by fighting the enemies that are there while exploring and meeting new characters along the way. It can take up to thirty minutes to an hour  to finish this build of the game. The game has multiple endings so there isn&#39;t just one although there is one definite ending for now that the player will come across once they have reached that part in the game. As I mentioned before, the objective is to get stronger so that you may defeat The Wicked One so defeating monsters and those other adventurers that you&#39;ll come across is key to making it to the end of the game where I have ended it off for now. I don&#39;t intend on this to be a difficult game to grasp since I originally intended to make a game where the player would progressively encounter monsters and gain experience along the way. You could say I intended it to be a dungeon crawler kind of game but it turned out to be more than just that as I kept on making more and more of the game. It&#39;s not in its final stages yet but it is playable (I hope) and if possible would like to improve any and all aspects of it whether it be too challenging or boring (how can I change that?) and so forth. Again, this game has been designed so that the story is easy to follow and so I hope that there isn&#39;t any confusion as to what is going on in the game although that may be the case. Anyway, I hope that you will be able to enjoy this game that I&#39;ve taken the time to create. If you could let me know how it is and/or what could be improved that would be much appreciated. I look forward to your response(s).
Characters:
Rolan: The protagonist of The Ascent. Little is known about his past except for the fact that this isn&#39;t the first time he has been to the island. He has been here before. He hopes to find treasure along the way. He&#39;s also a proud adventurer at heart.
Mai: A young woman who will stop at nothing to thwart the evil plans of the one known as The Wicked One. She automatically joins your party later on in the game.
Riona: She can be found on the island when you first arrive. Her lack of preparation stops her from moving forward.
?????: This character is secretly a mage but he sells stuff to make a living. He is one of the secret characters that can be unlocked. There will be other characters to unlock that are optional/secret in later releases.
?????: A young woman who sets out to Napel Island to check it out. Not much is known   about her but as the player progresses throughout the story more will be revealed about her.

Brink offers a compelling mix of dynamic battlefields, extensive customization options, and an innovative control system that will keep you coming back for more.
Brink takes place on the Ark, a man-made floating city that is on the brink of all-out civil war. Originally built as an experimental, self-sufficient and 100% “green” habitat, the reported rapid rise of the Earth’s oceans has forced the Ark to become home to not only the original founders and their descendants but also to thousands of refugees. With tensions between the two groups growing, Security and Resistance forces are locked in a heated battle for control of the Ark. Which side will you choose?

Brink allows you to seamlessly move between your single player campaign, co-op with friends, and intense multiplayer action. Multiplayer takes the story online where you can play with up to seven other people (or AI characters) cooperatively as you take on the opposing faction or with up to 16 players competitively.

When you press the SMART button, the game dynamically evaluates where you’re trying to get to, and makes it happen. Whether you’re a seasoned FPS veteran or someone just getting started, you’ll be able to make more intelligent decisions during the fast-paced action with SMART.

CarMODgeddon mods mode
The Car Is The Star! Carmageddon: Max Damage features a wide and varied range of cool, crazy, custom killing machines; each with its own highly distinctive “character”. Carmageddon cars are specifically built for the job in hand – wrecking opponents and killing peds! Nearly 20 years ago the original Carmageddon invented the whole concept of videogame physics and real-time damaging of cars and scenery, and so it’s obviously been our responsibility to bring this technology BANG up-to-date with a brand new state of the art car damage (and repair) system. Crush, bend, twist, and completely mangle your opponents’ and your own car – smash parts off, or split it in two; the original game was all about wrecking motors and pummelling pedestrians, and today we take this to a whole new level!  Power, Armour, and Offensive upgrades are available for your car, along with other customising options, allowing you to personalise the killing capabilities of your rides.
A host of old favourites from the original Carmageddon make a comeback, along with some all-new faces. Only ever seen before as low resolution mugshots, now you get to see them from head to toe (well, head to knees in the case of Screwie) in full HD 3D glory – usually as they smash through their windscreen and hurtle past (or INTO) yours!
The new environments are amalgamations of the best bits from the numerous chunks of landscape that we all loved to tear around in Carmageddon. “Bleak City”, &quot;Devil&#39;s Canyon&quot;, “Dusty Trails”, “MagNuChem” and &quot;Snowy&quot; levels all return in updated forms, with their memorable landmark features such as the Loop ’de’ Loop, acid pits and Football Stadium. Everything is reassuringly surreal; hell, we’ve even managed to incorporate a giant food mixer into a level!
The topography and detail in the locations is updated and enhanced, with even more fun stuff to smash into, smash up, snap off, and send careening into the poor pedestrian population. “Nice Shot Sir!” And talking of pedestrians…
Once again, the game features a varied mix of adult pedestrians of all ages, shapes, persuasions and species. Classic pedestrians are back, such as old lady on a Zimmer frame and old man with his stick, with their famous cry “I was in the war!”, plus bikini babes and swimming trunk hunks, fat bastards, and herds of cows in improbable locations. Joining them are some new faces – including cyclists, wheelchair users and peds on mobility scooters. Carmageddon is an equal opportunities ped slaughterfest!
PowerUps are back and this time they’re even funnier, surrealier, hurtier, and messier than ever! Lots of the classic PUps return in super-enhanced form, such as Repulsificators, Kangaroos &amp; Solid Granites. Then we have all new PUps like &quot;Pelvic Thrust&quot; and a variety under the heading “Tossers”! Combine PUps to create hilarious combo results like Groovin’ Helium Filled Peds, or Peds without legs at a Temporary Rapture!
Leaderboards. Challenge yourself to reach the top of the leaderboard using skill or brute force!
Achievements. A suitably warped array of mad Feats and Exploits will garner you the rewards that every gamer dreams of.
Challenges: Do the most stupid things, collect meaningless trinkets and waste hours of your life in the pursuit of ultimately pointless goals!
Smelly Bushes: We’ve hidden a variety of these specially fragrant Easter Eggs throughout the game to keep you busy and entertained!

1602,Close To The Sun,"It’s 1897. Deep in international waters, the Helios stands still. Dark clouds loom overhead as unforgiving waves crash against the hull. Colossal effigies of gold, decorated with magnificent finery, stretch as far as the eye can see.
Born of Nikola Tesla’s vision, the Helios serves as a haven for the greatest scientific minds. An unbound utopia for research, independent from state and isolated from the gaze of society. Free to push the boundaries of matter and time.
Journalist Rose Archer steps aboard the Helios in search of her sister Ada. She quickly discovers not all is as it seems. Grand halls stand empty. The stench of rotting flesh lingers in the air. Silence. A single word is painted across the entrance… QUARANTINE!",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/4e6/4e6a2e44f1181d72f1b12ac4613a9f39.jpg

1604,Commander: Conquest of the Americas,"Combining elements from both trading and strategy games, Commander: Conquest of the Americas will appeal to a wide range of players.  Players take charge of one of the many European powers aiming to conquer the New World. Starting from 16th century, players can choose from many different nations, each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses. Founding new colonies and then making them thrive is key to success.

1605,Company of Crime,"Company of Crime is a criminal empire-builder featuring tactical turn-based missions. Ittakes place in 1960s London, the cultural capital of the world and home to a plethora ofsubcultures and businesses. Your task is to build a company that will ownthe criminal underworld, or if you play as the chief inspector of Scotland Yard’s famous Flying Squad, tear it down piece by piece. In the process you will go to pubs, clubs, vets, tailors, harbors and many other locations as you expand your influence over the city. Your team consists of either gang members possessing the different skills required to pull off criminal tasks, or detectives that have mastered the art of investigation. The big question is ultimately this: who will take London?Features:Tactical turn-based melee combatWith a focus on melee combat and tight spaces, Company of Crime sets itself apart from other tactical turn-based strategy games. Units have a zone of control that makes them tied to the choices you make. Block enemy movements, build superiority in numbers, and gain flanking bonuses by attacking from behind. You can even kick enemies where the sun doesn’t shine to create safe passageways to units that would otherwise get free attacks. If someone grabs a gun, either find cover or go after them to wrestle it away before the bodies start piling up.Heat mechanicsWhen doing your dirty business, you’d be wise to silently extort your way through the underworld. Loud gunfire or shooting enemies will only attract more opposition, and a criminal empire that blows its cover won’t go far. Fighting the outcome of too much heat is always more difficult than avoiding it, and if things get too tough, you better have some leverage to get the cops off your back.Level progressionThis is more than just cops and robbers. Whatever the mission is, there is level progression beyond just hit points and stamina. Beating up the owner of a pub is one thing, but you can’t just bail before the police arrive. You’ll have to first assemble any evidence that will prove it was you at the crime scene crime scene before jetting.Building legit business with criminal meansBuilding a criminal empire requires a legitimate cover. Progression of the game takes place as you… ahem… “convince” people to sell their businesses and homes to you at a bargain price, or at least turn a blind eye to what you do in their back room. Owning more locations will unlock more items, features, and elements, but will also potentially expose you to a surprise attack from the police or a rival criminal family.Not just your own storyWhile your task is to create an empire of crime or to tear it down, this is not just your story. This is a story of 1960s London with beatniks, mods, lemonheads, rockers and every other cultural identity of the time. It’s also a story of a falling empire. The Cold War UK is shining in the cultural world, but is facing ever-increasing pressure from inside and out. There is a mysterious order trying to tear down the British Empire from the shadows, and who better to fight it than experts of the underworld and the famous Flying Squad.Reactive PoliceShady business takes place in obscurity, so police gameplay is more reactive. You get the call only when violence takes place, but that’s not the best way to find evidence against the criminal families. Assign sergeants to discover shady places, speak with informants, and apply for search warrants to raid questionable locales. Make sure they don’t burn the evidence before you manage to arrest them, or they’ll walk free as quickly as they were taken in.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/019/0195dc9ed0d6ab42ae68ca316875d0aa.jpg

There are many outcomes to the game while it is unknown which fraction prevails.

1615,Cursed Mountain,"
      Standing in Lhando, the eerily deserted village at the base of the 
      Sacred Mountain of the Himalayas, Chomolonzo, an icy chill hits your 
      veins. The summit looming in the distance holds the answers to your 
      brother’s disappearance, and you plan to bring him back – dead or alive. 
      Cursed Mountain is a survival/horror game designed specifically for Wii. 
      Players will take on the role of Eric Simmons as he tracks down his 
      brother, who went missing on a trek into the Himalayas to find an 
      ancient Buddhist artifact. A sensible man, when Eric first encounters 
      the angry spirits of the dead, he dismisses them as hallucinations 
      caused by altitude sickness. But as he ascends the mountain, it becomes 
      clear that something is very wrong... A curse has been placed on the 
      mountain; the dead spirits of the local monks and villagers are trapped 
      in the realm of the afterlife or bardo, unable to reach Nirvana or start 
      a new life cycle. Stuck in limbo, the restless spirits are very angry...
    
      Features 
    
      • Revolutionary - One of the first survival/horror games designed 
      specifically for Wii, Cursed Mountain creates a terrifying setting in a 
      stylized, atmospheric manner.• Original Setting - With advanced 
      graphics, Cursed Mountain places the player in a realistic Himalayan 
      environment. Players will immerse themselves in the local Buddhist 
      traditions and rituals. Everything in the game is based on real world 
      facts and research…except of course for the outbreak of restless souls.• 
      Vertical Level Design - As players ascend the mountain, they will 
      clearly see the summit in the distance, a looming reminder of their 
      final destination, and they can also look behind to see how far they’ve 
      come.• Innovative Wii Controls - Designed to mimic the physical 
      aspects of sacred prayer rituals, mantras, and gestures of Buddhism, 
      combat is comprised of gestures that release the spirits from the curse. 
      In addition, Cursed Mountain takes full advantage of Wii functionality, 
      supporting the Wii Remote speaker, rumble and motion-sensitivity in a 
      variety of triggered action events that mimic natural movements, such as 
      climbing, running and balancing.• Compelling Storyline - Players 
      investigate the disappearance of their brother who vanished while 
      searching for an ancient relic in the Himalayas. Players climb to the 
      top of Chomolonzo to discover the fate of their brother as well as to 
      stop the curse that’s interrupting Samsara – the Buddhist concept of 
      reincarnation.• Environmental Hazards - As players climb higher, the 
      mountain itself becomes an enemy. Prone to the travails of altitude 
      sickness and oxygen deprivation, players may not be able to tell the 
      difference between real enemies and hallucinated ones.

Brand New Engine: The dedicated team at 8monkey Labs has created an all-new, groundbreaking game engine known as Marmoset. The Marmoset engine not only breaks from the all-too present Unreal engine FPS clones flooding the market, but also allows for some amazing graphical capabilities.

You&#39;ll have to not only think about how to approach certain key battles and situations, but you&#39;ll also have to take care when fighting — certain key people that were never meant to die will be marked with a special blue aura. If you kill them, you&#39;ll face dire consequences…
Wreak Havoc with Future Weapons in Antiquity:  Something nearly every gamer that&#39;s ever played a shooter based in the past has always wanted is the ability to bring a futuristic weapon back through history and kick some major butt. How differently would Custer&#39;s last stand have turned out if the General was equipped with an M-16 assault rifle? You&#39;ll be able to answer questions like this in Darkest of Days. While not every battle and situation will allow you to wield weapons from the future, there will be plenty of opportunities for you to unleash futuristic fury on your unsuspecting foes.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/557/557bb4779a297bce4d37e79e0790af97.jpg

1646,Disjunction,"The year is 2048, and the world is plagued with economic downturn, environmental disaster, and societal destabilization. In the United States, natural resource starvation and severe climate change have led to massive urbanization, with millions of Americans forced to seek new lives among the sprawls of steel and concrete of America’s cities. These swelling urban populations, coupled with intense civil unrest, have culminated in greatly increased crime rates, with many cities becoming dense hives of vice and lawlessness. City governments and law enforcement do their best to stem the rising tide of crime, but are oftentimes ineffectual due to severe corruption and the increasing sophistication of American criminals.

1648,Drawn To Death,"Drawn to Death is a multiplayer shooter game. 
Gameplay
The shooter arena is set in a teenager’s notebook. The actions demonstrate the adolescent nature of a child’s illustrations.
The player performs from the third person perspective; he aims to fight off the enemies and discover the stage full of secret cages. The players have a variety of characters to choose from. Each one of them has its special attacks, tendencies, and attitudes. Before the game starts, the players can try a tutorial. Once they do that, they learn the mechanics of the game and the protagonist’s abilities. While playing, it is possible to add weapons, upgrades like skins and taunts, and improve the fighting skills. As time passes, mystery boxes appear on the way; there the player can find various items such as weapons or different upgrades. There are four player types, involving the classic Deathmatch. 
Key features
The game has its juvenile nature which widens throughout the scene. The unlocked weapons include a lizard flamethrower, a monkey throwing feces, and even a child’s hand which interacts in action. The shooting mechanics are quite childish as well, including a dash, a double jump, a kick, and other special moves. During the game, the characters make vulgar jokes accentuating the game’s details.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f8/2f89ddb6efb0cf9b0768aabc711c243b.jpg
1649,Duke Nukem Forever,"Duke Nukem is a larger-than-life macho who smokes cigars, speaks in one-liners, and has a kink for hot girls and big guns. Twelve years ago, Duke defeated invading aliens and became a worldwide celebrity, but now another invasion forces him to go out of retirement. He has to save all the Earth&#39;s women, who are being kidnapped by aliens. Most weapons are the same as in the original game. However, this time Duke cannot carry all his arsenals and is restricted to only two weapons at a time. He can also use “holoduke”, a holographic version of himself, to distract enemies. Duke restores his health over time using a new mechanic of “ego bar” — a measurement of Duke’s enormous ego that needs to be bolstered.
This belated sequel to Duke Nukem 3D spent 15 years in development, so it may feel like an artifact from another era. This is especially obvious from the game’s vulgar black humor. The protagonist may urinate, drink beer, and tell somewhat chauvinistic jokes about women. There&#39;s also controversial Capture the Babe multiplayer mode, based on &quot;capture the flag&quot;, but instead of flags, there are girls that have to be spanked.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/08a/08aa92e004f13ad2d41127327314c3f9.jpg

Each character has his or her unique set of skills and attacks. For example, Lucas, a knight, can withstand heavy damage in a melee fight. Katarina prefers ranged weapons and a little magic. Anjali is a shape-shifter who is a combination of both, depending on her current form, and Reinhart is a classic magician who uses energy spells.

Those people banded together into groups forming their own City-States. Italian immigrants in Little Italy formed the Mano Nera City-State, the police and government workers became the Tammany City-State and so on. Determined to survive and even thrive in this hostile environment, they turned to the sea for sustenance. What they could not provide themselves, they traded for with the “Mainlanders”. Fresh water pumped into the city through pipes. One day, the water stops flowing through the pipes. As the city watches it’s water reserves run lower and lower, it is you who will attempt to save them…FeaturesSuperb Story: Our game was penned by distinguished author and cartoonist Paul Noth. Neo-Victorian Setting: Steam technology has dominated all technological advances.  Authenticity:  Many aspects of 19th Century “Gilded Age” New York can be found in-game. Fast Tactics Combat System:  Plan your attack in peace and then execute it in Real Time.Art of Barter System: Barter weapons for weapons with traders. No money allowed.Nerve System: Nervous characters will at times fail you. But there are medicines for that.

Medicinal Items: Genuine Medical products, many of which contain poisonous substances. The GameEmpyre: Lords of the Sea Gates is a Role-Playing Game in the Classic sense. Our goal was to provide you with the familiar experience of looting, questing, character progression and more just like the old school games did. Aside from the graphical upgrade to the present day, we also wanted to forge our own path in the way we tell stories and the world we create for you. The 19th Century has a wealth of experiences to draw from that you don’t typically see in most games. That gives us a chance to give you something new. To give a few examples: Successful politicians were those with the largest gang of thugs and control over the Polling Stations. Workers Unions were coming of age around this time with frequent strikes and many times, strikebreakers. In gambling dens, dogs would fight rats. This is a sampling of some of the ideas we worked with in telling our stories. We also wanted you to feel that our world has a sense of Authenticity. In a flooded, Neo-Victorian version of New York, that sounds a little far-fetched. Yet, we did our research. You will meet real life figures from the era: Monk Eastman, Mock Dock, Silent Charlie Murphy. You will visit real life locations: The Tombs Prison, the Brooklyn Bridge.

Cliff Calo, son of wealthy media mogul Tom Calo, led a care-free life with little regard for the family business.

1667,Evertried,"""Every Move Matters""In Evertried, the player’s actions dictate when enemy units move. In other words, everything moves after you. The game plays out as fast or methodical as you want, featuring a free-flowing turn-based action combat system. Alternating between moving, attacking, using your dash, skills and luring enemies into hazards is the key to success. You are the one that decides the pacing of Evertried. Learn to think ahead. Develop intricate strategies to outmaneuver your opponents and follow your path to ascension!Test Your Strategic MightHitting or defeating enemies in succession increases your Focus Level, which determines the shards you receive and unlocks special powers called Modifiers. The Focus Level goes down when you are idle or just moving, so there is incentive to keep up the action. Luring enemies to traps and getting hit by hazards will also affect the gauge, adding to the strategy.Outsmart Enemies with Dashes and SkillsMoving strategically and attacking is vital. Close the gap with a Dash -- a mechanic that allows you to move twice the distance and ignore collision, allowing you to transverse an obstacle or gain a better position. Don’t forget Skills and Modifiers-- abilities and passive effects that can be equipped to create your build. Skills improve and carry over into successive runs, whereas Modifiers become stronger based on your Focus Level.Customize Your Ascent Toward DestinyThe Tower has 50 floors divided into 5 Areas. Each area is unique and introduces new types of enemies. The higher you get in The Tower, the more complex floors will become. Each area has a Shop Floor, where you can spend shards acquired in exchange for health recovery, Skills and Modifiers. Plan accordingly to increase your chance of getting to the top.Overcome the Guardians, Overcome Your WeaknessesEach area ends with a Floor Guardian, a boss battle to truly prove your strategic might. Upon losing all your health, the Warrior will dissipate and lose previously acquired powers, reappearing at the First Floor to start ascending again. However, mastery in Skills will carry over into following runs. Rise again Warrior, and face your destiny.STORYIn a world of unflinching order, The Tower is the beacon for lost souls that cannot be assigned to either eternal penitence or the afterlife. Its purpose is to provide lost souls the opportunity to prove their fate by climbing to the very top as a way of peregrinating.Without a clear memory of what happened, you know one thing: You did not prove your worth while alive. Through your first steps in The Tower, you are faced with a mindless beast, a wolf-like creature that looks aggressive and confused. As it rushes to attack you, you find an eerie Scythe and slay the beast where it stood. You feel a strange connection to your memories getting back. The weight of the weapon. The cold decision on how to wield it. There is no doubt: You were a warrior in your past life.Dying as a warrior is nothing strange, but warriors are received in the afterlife with glorious celebrations as they die honorably. Being tested after death could mean that your death wasn’t usual. Your death was without honor.The quickest way to prove your value as a warrior is through combat. And the clearest way to your past is seeking the one that oversees it all, The Tower’s creator. Determined to get your answers, you begin your climb, feeling your bond with your past life strengthening as you battle, searching for your past while fighting for your uncertain future.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/769/769f9905350209a77bbea55b6437fb12.jpg

Plot

As they consume other local animals, they can mutate into new, stronger creatures. The main protagonist in the story mode is William Cabot, a retired famous monster hunter, who comes to Shear to &quot;tame&quot; the planet and save the colonists from the monsters.
Gameplay
While the game has a single player campaign, it is oriented towards online multiplayer team deathmatches. The teams are asymmetrical: a group of four hunters opposes one monster. The hunters have to find and annihilate the monsters using their guns, jetpacks, and tracking devices. The monster&#39;s goal is to evolve. It requires him or her to prey on the smaller animals to gather experience and level up. Until the monster reaches its full power, it is very vulnerable.
Character classes
Both factions have several classes. The hunters have five characters in each of their four classes: Assault, Trapper, Support, and Medic. The monsters have five types: Goliath, Kraken, Wraith, Behemoth, and Gorgon. Both monsters and hunters only start with the basic characters and have to unlock the rest by defeating the enemies.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c30/c304b2c132f6bc1b6bcec5b03417a005.jpg

1671,F.E.A.R. 3,"The third game of the FEAR series of games. The general outline of the whole line of these games is the confrontation of special forces, to be more precise, a soldier named &quot;Operative&quot;, and a squad of super-soldier clones who refused to obey their superiors. Rebellious clone soldiers are capable of even cannibalism, and other details of the setting correspond to this level of fear.
Protagonists and antagonists have unusual abilities or conventional abilities, developed to an unusually high level. This is manifested, among other things, in the possession of ghostly forms, by which it is possible to mislead other people.
The game is strictly from the first person. A notable feature of the gameplay is the slow motion mode. In this mode, the player accelerates the perception to such an extent that it can see the flying bullets. This gives him obvious advantages. The slow motion mode, in the game, is explained by the increased content of adrenaline in the blood, which occurs in a person, in a situation that threatens life. If this condition is caused in a natural way, then it does not last long. It can be extended with the help of a special drug, which is included in the number of useful game stuff. Sometimes this mode is &quot;turned on&quot; during visions that visit the hero and act on him as much as the danger.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1da/1da9a7af524e81d257f972fbc06baefd.jpg

1677,Fallout 76,"Fallout 76 is a multiplayer-only game set in the universe of Fallout series. It is the first MMO game in the Fallout franchise and ninth installment overall. It is also the earliest game in the Fallout universe inner chronology, thus serving as a prequel to the whole series.
Setting
The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, a quarter century after a nuclear holocaust that turned most of the US into a radioactive wasteland. The players assume the roles of the various dwellers of Vault 76, presumably the first Vault-Tec bunker to release its inhabitants. Their goal is to reclaim the world. The vault is located in the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia. Fallout 76 offers an open world with many locations based on real West Virginia places. Some of the new monsters are also based on the local folklore.
Gameplay
Unlike all previous games in its series, Fallout 76 features no human NPCs (although robots and monsters are present). Instead, the game delivers the story through records and environment. Some of Fallout series famous mechanics return in Fallout 76. The character creation is based on a modified version of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system of abilities and perks. V.A.T.S. targeting system also appears, albeit this time it works in real-time. The game allows the players to build homes and establish settlements in any part of the map. There are also nuclear missiles that allow the players to annihilate each other&#39;s settlements.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/151/151e79f397328419c64aabe93d9d5a31.jpg
1678,Fallout Shelter,"The game is a simulation of managing a refuge.

Your task is to develop and expand your shelter, as well as to fight enemies, to resist the attacks of raiders and other representatives of the Wasteland. 
To obtain resources, you need to assign people to the appropriate premises, properly distributing their skills between strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck. Each character characteristic will affect how well he produces a particular type of resources and how high his chances to survive in the Wasteland. 
An essential aspect of the game is the correct use of resources and their balance. And with a deficit of one, there are difficulties. For example, the lack of electricity disrupts the premises, the lack of water leads to radiation exposure of residents, and food — to the loss of health. You also need to protect themselves from attacks by raiders, mutated rats,  ghouls and other creatures.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a91/a911f0a91991469e398fa70091507a5b.jpg

Playing as a counselor is all about risk and reward, giving players multiple means of triumph over Jason! Want to hide in the woods as you wait for the police?

1713,Hardware: Rivals,"Hardware: Rivals is an online multiplayer combat game where players perform as vehicles. This is the second edition of the series, the successor of Hardware: Online Arena. 
Gameplay
The goal is to win races, survive through attacks, hit other vehicles and complete challenges. The player can either ride Tanks, also known as the Predators, or Fast Attack Vehicles, also known as the Wraiths.
FAVs are fast and graceful but can’t carry much damage. Tanks are heavy and slow but can survive through lots of hits. There are three maps available: “Blister Lake,” “Quarry” (also known as “Jackson&#39;s Pit”) and “Lost Temple.”
Each one has its challenges. They provide something different to do while the player is riding. For example, a challenge to drive through the underground bunker on Blister Lake as fast as possible; or jump over the temple on The Lost Temple as far as possible. The player can set a score for a challenge at any time during races. If he beats others&#39; scores, he can be offered to challenge friends who also play Hardware. 
Key features
Each vehicle is equipped with a weapon that never runs out of ammo. The weapon is used to damage or even finish off opponents. Tanks have a shell that carries a heavy thrust but requires accuracy for each shot. FAVs has a turret mounted heavy machine gun that has a wide area of the shooting. The player can find a secondary weapon located around the arenas. These pickups are more powerful than the primary weapons.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc2/cc23696a29992979fbc6d1b4f30d2db5.jpg

After waking from a five week coma, Theo Kavinsky finds his life in disrepair, and with no memory of the accident, it’s up to Ted and Teddy – the conscious and subconscious voices in his head – to work out what happened, and put his life back on track.  Headspun is an FMV/Adventure hybrid which puts you in the shoes of Ted: the Director of Cortex - the rational, intelligent voice in Theo's head.

Headspun is a game about recovery, discovery, and the ongoing battle between logic and emotion.

In the course of the completion, players will follow the characters on their way to the key of the murderer’s mystery. Heavy Rain is an unusual action-adventure game. All four main characters are controlled from the third-person perspective with only several buttons, as the interaction with the environment is usually done by activating on-screen prompts like holding the trigger, pushing a button, positioning the stick, or all in one. The gameplay consists of multiple scenes, which affect the further in-game progress by the players’ choice and create a branching storyline that can lead to various endings including the death of certain main characters.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0af/0af85e8edddfa55368e47c539914a220.jpg

1719,Hellpoint,"Hellpoint is a dark sci fi action RPG set in the aftermath of a massive quantum cataclysm. Every living being quickly lost their mind as their memories and bodies were merged with alternate versions of themselves from parallel universes. The accident also attracted entities of immense power that should have been left alone, in the depth of other dimensions.
You play as a mysterious nameless character whose intentions are entirely determined by your choices. You wake up in the derelict Irid Novo space station, in orbit around a super-massive black hole.
In the game, the space station orbits in real time around the ominous black hole. Its position in the sky directly impacts the sanity of the inhabitants of the station. The singularity is doing more than simply distorting the fabric of space and time; based on the time of the orbit, enemies in the levels get crazier or struck by fear, unknown entities roam the corridors and dozens of other mysterious events can occur.
Hellpoint is based on a peculiar structure called the Quantic System. It is a series of interconnected systems that are utilizing a server clock to decide when and where a particular dynamic event should occur. You can see a preview of that system in our demo linked below. You venture in a corridor that you previously walked through, and suddenly a new passage is opened. A tall menacing mini-boss is now patrolling where there was no one before. Enemies cower in fear as you approach them, or charge you in a fit of rage. A boss suddenly grows tougher and more aggressive, but also drops more valuable loot. It is up to you to figure out what events happen where and when so that you can exploit them to your advantage.
In Hellpoint, the Black Hole is truly the master of the dungeon.
Irid Novo was once a shining beacon of intergalactic collaboration, built to research advanced artificial intelligence and quantum mechanics. Now, it is a dark and dangerous place dominated by the will of the cosmic gods. It is best to explore Irid Novo with the help of a friend.
Hellpoint supports splitscreen co-op and player versus player on all platforms. You can play the whole game with a friend, or have him jump up in and out anytime he likes. The loot is shared, and the experience of player two is saved and not watered down. In our youth, we&#39;ve had countless nights of couch gaming fun, playing with friends and siblings until the sun rose. With Hellpoint, we want to bring back couch gaming into a genre that we think cruelly lacks it.
For centuries, the galaxy has been at peace. With the discovery of interstellar travel and the access to infinite resources that ensued, brutal wars are now a thing of the past. To survive the wrath of cosmic gods and hordes of monsters, you will have to find ancient blueprints and craft long forgotten weapons and armors and acquire forbidden powers. You play the way you want, will it be a sword and a shield, or a firearm and your mastery over the cosmic energies?
Hellpoint allows you to play the way you want. Using our crafting and customization system, you can adjust your weapons and powers according to your own play style. Do you prefer your healing power to heal more over time or instantaneously? Go edit your power in one of the crafting station, and make it work the way you like. Would you prefer your energy missiles to explode on impact, or to ricochet off enemies? The choice is yours to modify them as you see fit.
The more you fight with a weapon, the more proficient you become with it and eventually you unlock powerful abilities. This can go from an extra long range combo attack to a shattering explosion that sends enemies flying.
A terrible quantum cataclysm happened on board Irid Novo and is spreading to the whole multiverse. Piercing the very fabric of space to reach parallel universes is not something mortals should be allowed to play with. However, those breaches into other universes could very well be the key for you to make things right...
Every time you start a new game, the station is different. Rooms, enemies, puzzles, events, all are parts of the multiverse. This means that while our level design is carefully hand crafted, no two games are exactly the same. The game stay fresh as you never know what to except around the corner. As you die, you are pulled away from your universe of origin, and you wake up into the next. The more you die, the more the world changes around you.",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7b/a7b00877d6290eedbf051cde0f814c0d.jpg

1726,Hydrophobia: Prophecy,"Hydrophobia Prophecy is an improved version of the game Hydrophobia, designed for the PlayStation 3 and Steam. Hydrophobia Prophecy includes both new levels (updated approximately 70% of the content) and levels already exist, but have undergone significant processing.
Both the original and the reworked version of the game are created as part of the action-adventure genre with elements of survival horror in the cyberpunk style.
Place and time of action
The game takes place in the middle of the XXI century. By this time, the world is plunged into chaos caused by great overpopulation. Lands suitable for food production are destroyed by rising ocean levels and the spread of deserts. Hunger and misery reign in the world. The most precious resource of humanity in these conditions is simple drinking water.
The game takes place on board a giant cruise liner comparable in size to the city. The liner is called Queen of the World, it was built by a group of giant corporations to create comfortable conditions for the elected representatives from among the managers of these corporations.
History
At the very beginning of the game, a group of terrorists is attacking and seizing a ship. The terrorists call themselves &quot;Neo Malthusians&quot; (after the economist Thomas Malthus, who predicted the death of humanity from overpopulation). They plan to kill many people so that the world will return to a state fit for a full life. Attacking the liner, the terrorists painted the walls with their slogans, the same slogans are broadcast on screens all over the ship. One of the slogans: “Save the World - Kill Yourself!”.
The terrorists are attacking a diner to get a tool for global genocide, killing about 10 billion people - such tools are in the secret laboratories of one of the Five Corporations located on the liner - “NanoCell Corporation”.
The protagonist, system engineer of the ship Kate Wilson, was responsible for the safety of the liner - when as a result of an attack by terrorists the ship begins to sink, Kate seeks to survive and tries to prevent the terrorists. What she needs for this, too, is in these secret laboratories.
Gameplay
One of the creators of the game described the gameplay as a “player against the environment”, meaning, first of all, water - water constantly interacts with everything it comes in contact with, and it gives an incredible variety of situations, sets of options for changing circumstances.
Water floods the liner, constantly changing the configuration of spaces suitable for action and movement. The player must constantly adapt to this and respond quickly.
Other characters can also affect the situation, and this effect also leads to a redistribution and movement of water. Water may involve other objects and substances in its actions — for example, a gasoline stain that has spread through water may ignite and burn, while water carries these fiery stains throughout the ship.
The action can occur both on the surface of the water and in its thickness.
HydroEngine, an engine capable of solving this problem with unprecedented realism, was created to simulate flowing water in all its variety for the game.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d0e/d0e19cbeefb72e26bf97aea045876103.jpg

1729,I Am Fish,"I Am Fish is a charming, physics-based adventure starring four intrepid fish friends, forcibly separated from their home in a pet shop fish tank. Over the course of the game you join them as they swim, fly, roll and chomp their way to the open ocean from the far-flung corners of Barnardshire (the smallest county in England) in their bid for freedom and to re-unite once again.
FINTASTIC FRIENDS
Meet our heroes! Goldfish - cheerful, brave, and adventurous, a natural born swimmer! Pufferfish – a little slow but kind-hearted who can also puff up into a ball and roll across land. Piranha - wild, chaotic, loud, unpredictable, and loves to bite - obviously. Flying Fish – a little aloof at times but a real softy at heart, with the ability to glide through the air! These plucky heroes will leave no bowl unturned, putting their heart and shoal into the mission to re-unite!
NO NEED TO BE A BRAIN STURGEON
Swim, roll, glide, chomp, flip flop, inflate, fly and bite your way through enthralling challenges. A simple, intuitive control scheme leaves no excuses should your fish perish leaving you feeling very gill-ty.
THINK OUTSIDE THE BOWL
With its idyllic coastline and quaint villages Barnardshire might seem like a perfect slice of quintessential tranquility, but to our aquatic adventurers it’s alive with the very real threats presented by crossing roads, traversing rooftops, dodging deep fat fryers, avoiding wildlife including the cantankerous locals, not to mention fragile fishbowls and the very real problem that fish can’t breathe out of water.
LEAVE NO FISH BEHIND
We won’t dwell on grizzly fish death, but should your fish fall too far in whatever make-shift fishbowl it finds itself in, run out of air or generally flounder you will be popped back to the most recent checkpoint to refine your approach.
SWIM TO FREEDOM
Our four fin-tastic friends will be hitching rides in all manner of ad hoc water carriers including jars, mop buckets on wheels and the occasional pint glass. Cheers! Navigating in each make-shift aquatic vehicle poses its own unique challenge, but don’t worry, the relative freedom of open water is never too far away with inviting fountains, swimming pools and err, sewers full of hazardous materials to splash around in, before reaching the final goal – the shimmering, open ocean.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/deb/debed1495adeac69fd5f0be501ecae35.jpg

GAMES BEYOND™
New sub-category for Jujubee&#39;s products characterized by a greater emphasis on the story being told, original gameplay, and mature subject matter.
&quot;We believe the time has come to tell real stories. In an age in which we compete for the free time of consumers against the entire entertainment industry, including movies and TV series, and when people are less likely to read non-fiction, game producers have an additional obligation. It&#39;s true that games are becoming more complex, offering an incredible audio-visual experience, and allowing us to lose ourselves in a virtual world, but they rarely help us grow. That is why we want to step outside the self-contained world of video game subject matter and invite players to broaden their knowledge about history or the actual world. We’re convinced that KURSK will be a very attractive title to anyone looking for an ambitious and mature game&quot; - said Michal Stępien, CEO of Jujubee.Extras included in Standard Version:

Written just for you.You are met with silence. No barking orders from the director. No call to action that you need to become this version of yourself. The demand to act fills your mind, but the script pages hold no words.
Your past has helped to mold you into what you are, forced upon you the skills required to hone your craft. That same past has scraped deep furrowing scars into you, not on the outside where the world can see, but in a place buried so deep within that it has become shapeless. You push those memories down but let the experiences drive you into who, or what, you must play.
Darkness surrounds as you stand silently in the spotlight, the only sounds to be heard over your heartbeat are the distant breaking of waves against the hull and the sound of cameras pointed in your direction preserving this moment for eternity.
A deep and commanding voice rises from the distance. Act.
What part will you play?

Plot
The main protagonist is Beck, a battle android from the Mighty Numbers series (his number is 9). A virus attack led to a machine uprising, and Mighty No. 9 is among the few robots that were not infected. His creator, Dr. White, sends him to stop his rampaging kin and find out who is behind the attack. The Xel technology allows Beck to bring his fellow Numbers back to reason. He will also assimilate their data to send it back to the lab so that Dr. White could find the cure for the virus. Beck is occasionally assisted by Call, a female robot unaffected by the virus.
Gameplay
The player controls Beck in a 2D environment. Like in Mega Man, the protagonist jumps platforms and fires a gun. Beck can also use the special acceleration ability that allows him to leap long distances and through his enemies. By leaping through injured opponents, Beck can assimilate their Xel to receive a temporary power-up. The type of a power-up depends on the color of a Xel: red gives Beck more powerful attacks, green speeds him up, yellow improves his stamina, and blue heals him. Gathering Xel from Mighty Numbers, Beck receives new special abilities.
Multiplayer
The game includes a cooperative multiplayer for two, in which the second player controls Call. Her gameplay is very different and is largely defensive as she uses deflector shields to protect herself and Beck.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/fb0/fb05d26860505d5bc58619f9b8359c15.jpeg

A hero can do many things in our world, but not all. Can be present everywhere and even pass through the walls (but not in closed houses, only through open doors and windows). Can see what ordinary people see, read, think. But he can not take and move things, cannot talk with living people - for actions with objects and communication he has to find a girl-medium.
In the game, you need to collect evidence and draw conclusions from this. Ways to extract proof are sometimes very exotic. For example, a hero can penetrate the memory of a witness and find there information that the witness himself cannot remember. The hero can meet other ghosts, who were once people and killed - after talking with them, you can learn about the circumstances of this.
Finding evidence and reasoning is not the only thing that you have to do. The hero can be killed a second time, and it will be definitive - some disembodied beings seek to destroy the hero&#39;s soul. But they are vulnerable, and the hero can kill them.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/54a/54a3e4c617217848dc43c4de9989fe37.jpg

Explore the village, plant musical gardens, choose who you want to talk to, and find your way through an in-game week of small-town drama and scenic hangouts.

1811,My Memory of Us,"Do you like stories? If so, then I’ll tell you one. But it won’t be just any old story. It’s going to be different, because it’s about real people, about events that are touching and horrifying even now. Let’s go back in time. It all began with a meeting between a boy and a girl who came from two different worlds. For a short time they had good laughs together, taking joy simply from each other’s company. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. War broke out – the Evil King plundered the city and his robot-soldiers appeared everywhere. Citizens were separated and some of them were marked and forced to move out of their homes and live in a place that was sealed off from the rest of the city by a huge wall. Fortunately the children were not alone – they had each other. Their friendship allowed them to stay together, even though fate seemed to try to tear them apart. That’s the story behind My Memory of Us, a game dedicated to those that were separated, but managed to find the strength to meet each other again.
What makes My Memory of Us stand out is that the story is told from the perspective of two friends who complete each other. Each of them has their own abilities – she can run fast, he can sneak – but only when they work together as a team can they overcome all adversities. You just want to have fun with your friend. Go on then! Grab her hand and find out what adventures are waiting for you outside. Together, there’s nothing in the world that can stop you.

Three characters — Tyler, Mac, and Jess — are trying to avenge Lina who betrayed the crew from the very start.

1828,Ninja Blade,"It was July 7th, 2011.
While investigating reports of unlawful weapons trafficking, peacekeeping forces encountered an unclassified carnivorous species occupying a small village in Northern Africa. 
					These rabid creatures were easily provoked and resistant to conventional attack. Eight specimens were encountered in the region now referred to as ""Ground:ALPHA""...
					Only four were successfully contained for study. Victims of the attack were quarantined at a research facility nearby. These victims displayed signs of internal liquefaction and accelerated necrosis, similar to symptoms of other flesh-eating viruses native to that region.
But it wasn't a viral outbreak. It was a parasitic infestation. A previously unidentified species of hook worm was found beneath the skin of the Ground: ALPHA specimens.
					These parasites, we call them ""Alpha-worms"", laid dozens of eggs inside their hosts, which in turn produced numerous larvae. These larvae penetrated the bloodstream and triggered a variety of genetic failures. However, unlike most genetic failures, these symptoms were not fatal. Instead, infested victims were larger, stronger… and driven by hunger. 
					Using the research gained from the Ground: ALPHA specimens, a team of some special individuals were assembled. Minor outbreaks occurred over the next few years, but elite squad quickly put them down. Which brings us to the current situation in Tokyo...

No Man&#39;s Sky gameplay implies the exploration of space and planets some of which are inhabited with extra-terrestrial life, gathering resources, space battles, maintaining and upgrading the player&#39;s ship and completing bounty hunting missions. The main objective is to reach the center of the galaxy. 
On release, it was stated that the game is in fact multiplayer, but the size of its world is so big that the probability of meeting another player is extremely small. It turned out that it is impossible to meet any other player due to the extremely limited multiplayer aspect. As of 2018, Hello Games released the fourth major update which included the full multiplayer experience.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/174/1743b3dd185bda4a7be349347d4064df.jpg

1846,Post Scriptum,"Post Scriptum is a WW2 simulation game, focusing on historical accuracy, large scale battle, difficult learning curve and an intense need for cohesion, communication and teamwork. Players will relive the events of ‘Operation Market Garden’ across the fields and towns of Holland. This massive Allied assault consisted of a coordination of the British and American Airborne to capture key bridges while the British XXXth Corps moved to reinforce them through Highway 69. However, consecutive delays in consolidating ground from the north of Belgium through Nijmegen forced the 1st British Airborne Division in Arnhem to make a stand much longer than anticipated. With no successful link between the XXXth Corps and the Airborne in sight, the seventh and final bridge in Arnhem was considered lost.
‘The Bloody Seventh’ is our name for the initial focus of the project as we feel it succinctly details the struggle that the British paratroopers had to endure while waiting for their army counterpart to establish a link through the lower Rhine.
Players will be given the option to fight with the British Airborne Division, British XXX Corps or several branches of the German Army, such as the Wehrmacht or the Waffen SS. It’s a rare opportunity to experience the intense battlefield that was the Battle of Arnhem, which stretched across farms, woods, villages and city areas.

1888,Shenmue III,"Shenmue III is the third part in the Shenmue series of martial action games. Being the belated sequel to 2001 Shenmue II, the game also serves as the series&#39; revival. 
Plot
Shenmue III continues the story of the protagonist of the previous games: Ryo Hazuki, a young Japanese martial artist from the city of Yokosuka. His goal is to avenge the death of his father. Hazuki follows the murderer, Lan Di, to the mountainous region in China called Guilin. A young Chinese girl named Ling Shenhua, who shares a mysterious spiritual bond with Ryo, accompanies him on his quest. There&#39;s a prophecy that their destinies are intertwined. 
Ryo and Ling walk through various Chinese villages, temples, and fortresses, fighting enemies on their way. They face not only Lan Di but also a new villain named Niao Sun. While the game is set outside Japan, Hazuki can stay in touch with his friends back home by calling them on the phone.
Development
The game spent more than ten years in development due to high costs of the original two games (the first Shenmue was the most expensive game ever at the time of its release). Shenmue III only came to be made because of a crowdfunding campaign. This is not the final part of the story, according to the series&#39; creator Yu Suzuki, who is planning more Shenmue games.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/eb5/eb5e27de42914c71aa0b688ae05b58f9.jpg
1889,Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One,"His legend begins with you!
Before he was the world’s greatest detective, Sherlock Holmes was a brilliant rebel itching to prove himself. When an old wound compels him back to the Mediterranean shore where his mother died, it seems like the perfect opportunity to do just that—but beneath the vibrant urban veneer of the island, the rhythm of island life strikes a more ominous beat. Crime and corruption, a twisted sense of justice and morality... These are just a few stumbling-blocks in Sherlock’s quest for truth.
As Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world. Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal—your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another.
Whether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills. It’s time to confront your past so you can become the legend you’re destined to be.
KEY PILLARS:
The Man Before: As a cavalier young Sherlock on the precipice of adulthood, you’ll earn your reputation in a way no game or story has explored before. We’ve never seen the youthful arrogance and naiveté of the man before the legend—now you’re living it.
Global Investigation: You never know where your next clue will come from. Explore and exploit the entire city in your pursuit of truth, using clues, rumors, disguises, tags, and pinned evidence to build a solid case within your mind palace.
And Stay Down: Weapons might help you in a pinch, but there’s something to be said for style—and you have it in spades. Spot enemy vulnerabilities with your brilliant observation skills, or exploit the environment to take someone down while keeping your own hands clean.
A Different Jon: Before John Watson, there was a different Jon - your best and only friend. But who is he, really?
A Darkening Tide: A vibrant open-world island in the Mediterranean promises anything but paradise. Political corruption and crime run rampant while the islanders cling to tradition and eschew outsiders, making your job even more difficult.
Truth and Lies: There are two sides to every story, and the proud islanders have their own ideas about truth and justice. It’s up to you to decide whether uncovering the truth will do more harm than good—and how that will shape the man you’ll become.",https://media.rawg.io/media/games/60c/60ca6f84551e6f5435d97b603a77d551.jpg

1899,Sin Slayers,"
Sin Slayers is an RPG with roguelike elements set in a dark fantasy world, where your choices determine how challenging the fights and enemies will be.


Create, equip and lead a team of heroes. Each unit will have its own abilities and weaknesses, so plan your combat strategy accordingly. You’ll journey through stinking primeval forests, boneyards riddled with crypts and the graves of fallen warriors, and other places even the bravest adventurer would fear to tread.


Battles, traps, and bizarre enemies... Everything and everyone wishes to take your life, but don't succumb to despair. Between fights your party can take their rest at a fountain, or while on the road in an old church which leaves its doors open to the weary and wounded.


Travel every path and byway of the Valley, obtain new weapons on the field of battle or by fulfilling quests, gather ingredients for magical elixirs and resources to craft armor and amulets. If a certain item is beyond your crafting ability, ask the blacksmith in the Old Church for help. The best gear will allow you to challenge the deadliest monsters.



The souls of many heroes were cursed upon death, leaving them to wander a dark and uncharted world, an afterlife reserved for sinners. Is this the end, or..?


Gather your team. Equip them with weapons, armor, and amulets. Level up your abilities as you move forward. The Sin Lords must be slain.




Sin Slayers features a classic turn-based combat system in the tradition of the best JRPGs, giving you free rein to pit your tactical skills against the wretched inhabitants of the Valley of Fallen Sinners.


Steel yourself. Enemies are everywhere and you will need to make difficult decisions and face dire peril to prevail.




Depending on your choices, the sinfulness of your team will go up or down. If it's high — expect tougher enemies. Whatever might be buried there, is it wise to desecrate those graves? Every decision you make matters, and on the road to the next Sin Lord you will have many opportunities to choose poorly.




Every crusade against a Sin Lord will be unique as every location is randomly generated. Think you know everything there is to know about a fetid swamp? We promise there are new lessons to learn, though they may not be to your liking!




Legends tell of a place betwixt worlds, a region outside time and space called the Valley of Fallen Sinners.


A dense, preternatural fog lays like stinking breath over black woods. What cursed hordes await? Vicious beasts, damned warriors, the undead, and worse chthonian horrors, all with an unslakable craving for new souls to perpetuate their own unnatural life.


This region is for the most contemptible cowards, those who died because of their sins and the darkness weighing down their souls. At one time, they lived as brave heroes across a multitude of worlds, and bards composed ballads to their noble deeds. Until the day darkness flooded their hearts and killed them.


Now regret consumes them, but their souls will find no rest. They are doomed to wander the Valley endlessly, searching for rest, respite, an end to their torture. But they will know no peace until someone destroys the seven seals of the Portal of the Worlds. Only then will the gates open and the damned finally escape their prison...

The &quot;Baron&quot; has devised a plot to mine the world’s Sparklite core. He mines Sparklite and burns it to fuel his powerful war machines. The resulting pollution is corrupting the world. Animals have turned into violent monsters and the environment is slowly rotting away. Thankfully the world has a natural defense - its Sparklite core. Periodically, the core causes a disruption which rearranges the layout of the world, setting back the Baron’s efforts. If the Baron can obtain the core, he’ll gain the power to create a new world where he has ultimate power.
Our hero, Ada, must travel to each zone of the world to shut down the Sparklite digsites, lowering the Baron’s defenses so that she can stop him before it’s too late...",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d1/7d17d7e55980764359b62b75e9e3b699.jpg

1944,Survive the Blackout,"This is the way the world ends
Not with a bang but a whimper.
-- T.S. Eliot
SURVIVE THE BLACKOUT is a narrative survival game set in a dark post-apocalyptic world where a mysterious global power outage sends the civilization spiraling down into chaos. The player becomes the reluctant leader of a small group of survivors and try to get them to a safe haven. In their journey, every step is a choice to make, and none of them will be simple.
Manage a small team of survivors
Carefully make your choices as a branching narrative unfolds
Scavenge for supplies and manage your resources
Explore the world after the fall of civilization in multiple unique playthroughs
Be the relentless leader the survivors need in the harsh reality of the civilization in ruins, make all the dramatic choices, and face their consequences. Experience the story unfolding differently each time you play. Find out, what are YOU willing to sacrifice to Survive the Blackout!
The world of Survive the Blackout isn’t your average extravagantly stylized, farfetched post-apo setting. The game presents a plausible scenario of the fall of human civilization. A global power outage caused by factors unknown to general public is enough for the better part of the modern world to crumble and the society to collapse. The dire consequences of such an event are powerful enough, without the need to include any supernatural or fantastic motifs.
How did the Blackout affect the world? The survivors will travers different regions, each with its own flavor, local storylines, unique risks and opportunities. Through their eyes the player will experience the familiar world reduced to ruin and filled with desperation.
The apocalypse doesn’t make people more interesting, than they already are. But it tends to bring out the best, the worst, and the weirdest in people. The story of post-apocalypse is best told from many different personal perspectives. Anyone who ever played a game like Fallout or other genre RPG or adventure will remember how the world came alive with all the NPCs, telling their stories, adding their own colorful presence to the overall experience.
Preppers. Looters. Orphans. Healers. Murderers. Psychos. Beggars. Loners. Heroes. Opportunists. Thieves. Each of Everyone you meet on the road is a person with their own story, motivation, and personality. Each encounter lets you experience the story of humanity’s fall a little deeper.
With all the rules gone, without the safety that civilization provides, each decision you make becomes a matter of life and death. Survive the Blackout is a narrative game where you make choices reacting to the circumstances your group of survivors face. It is up to you if you want to base them on morals, desperate will to survive, or some other ideals. Whatever you decide, you will have to bear in mind not only the immediate, but also the long-term consequences of your actions.
Managing supplies, issuing orders, moving forward, protecting the party, keeping the morale and giving everyone a sense of purpose is the daily labor of the leader. The party will offer you their take on the matters, but will you listen to them, or try to force your own ideas? It’s all up to you.
Survive The Blackout is an open-ended, and non-linear experience, because we want it to mimic life as well as a small indie game can manage. But we also want it to be finite and satisfying. Playing the game from start to finish will always provide you with a whole story. A different story in every playthrough, based on your decisions and luck, but a complete story nonetheless.
While we hope that the sales of our title provide us with means and motivation to develop its world and the story even further via future content expansions, our main focus is to keep true to how we think games should be developed and sold: as complete products, and not as a “service”.
It would mean a lot to us, if you considered adding Survive the Blackout to your Steam Wishlist. Baby Bison Games is a small, Warsaw-based indie team aiming to deliver an ambitious survival adventure. We’re taking the (nowadays less-travelled) path of truly independent development, declining investors and publishers in favor of complete freedom to make and sell the game on our own terms. If you like what you see here you can show us your support by wishlisting Survive the Blackout!",https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43a/43a2e9bb036e8de9a4fe0b53718b524e.jpg

The first part of the title cues the players into realizing the role of Nicola Tesla in the narrative.
It is little to invent in the point-and-click genre, but the development of Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure is presumably cut into two parts: actual cutscene and backgrounds filming and composing it all into the game content.
